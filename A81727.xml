            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I do profeſſe, had I ſeen the Lord carrying forth any of my brethren (whoſe abilities in judgment and clearneſs of expreſſion, far exceed mine) to have undertaken a work of this nature, I ſhould have rejoyced in my owne ſilence. But hitherto have I not known any to ſtand up in this cauſe; and ſurely if all ſhould be ſilent, <hi>The Stones would ſpeake.</hi>

               <p>All people have a kinde of <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſerving of God with <hi>prayers,</hi> ſacrifices, and the like; therefore the <hi>Heathens</hi> choſe their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and others, to have a care of their <hi>Gods,</hi> and the ſervice of their <hi>Gods.</hi> Men of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Fooles</hi> acknowledge this. The <hi>Schooles</hi> of the <hi>Academicks, Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> rung of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The <hi>barbarous Indies</hi> gainſay it not.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the <hi>harmony</hi> in this (via:) that there is a <hi>God,</hi> &amp; that this God is to be <hi>worſhipped,</hi> is ſo great and wonderfull; yet the <hi>diſcord</hi> concerning this God what he is, and what is his true worſhip is as great and ſtrange.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117308:10"/>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> acknowledged him to be, but knew him not. Man being unable to <hi>comprehend</hi> the incomprehenſible being, hath from time to time, according to his vaine imagination, fancyed a God or Gods to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> had as many <hi>Gods</hi> as <hi>Townes:</hi> what they received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good from, they reverenced as their God. Hence it came that they worſhipped the <hi>Sunne, Moone, Starres,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> yea even <hi>Dogges</hi> and <hi>Birds</hi> for their Gods.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> perceiving a miracle to be wrought by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> preſently lift up their voices, ſaying, <hi>The Gods are come</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> 
                  <hi>downe to us:</hi> calling <hi>Paul, Jupiter:</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Mercurius:</hi> the names of their heathen Gods. And the Apoſtles could ſcarcely reſtraine the <hi>Priests</hi> from ſacrificing to them.</p>
               <p>From this blind conceipt ariſes as blind a ſacrifice; ſometimes men, women, children, beaſts and birds, have beene offered by them as well-pleaſing ſacrifices to their Gods.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>ignorance</hi> of the true GOD, and his worſhip, hath ſprung that <hi>Ataxy Confuſion</hi> and <hi>diſorder</hi> that is in the world; hence comes <hi>murders, rebellions, treaſons, witchcrafts, ſorceries, uneleaneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, perſecutions, ſelf-exaltation,</hi> and all abhominations in the world.</p>
               <p>This deluge of darkneſſe hath not only drowned ſome families, Townes, Cities, Countries, Kingdomes and generations, but hath overwhelmed the whole world in all ages. Man no ſooner ſteps into the world, but darkneſſe is his dwelling place. <hi>Nature</hi> once was adorned with this glory of knowing GOD the Creator in the true light of the firſt Creation; but now through tranſgreſſion are all ſhut up and concluded under ſinne, wrath and darkneſſe: That it might be made manifeſt, that ſalvation is onely in that Arke that ſwims above all theſe waters, (viz:) in the free grace, mercy and goodneſſe of the Lord in Jeſus Chriſt, by revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the ſons of men, and giving them a righteous law to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him by: that ſo they might not ignorantly forge a God in and by their owne underſtandings to themſelves, and fall downe and worſhip their owne Creature inſtead of the Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, but might ſee GOD in his owne light. For in thy light O GOD doe thy Saints ſee light, even the true light the Lord Jeſus. As that light hath diſcovered him to me, and the onely acceptable ſervice and worſhip of him, this enſuing Treatiſe declares.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humane Worſhip,</hi> which is a ſervice of mans own invention, that hath a forme of the true worſhip of God, but is will-worſhip, vain worſhip not commanded by the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Devilliſh Worſhip,</hi> that is, When Devils or dumbe Idols are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: theſe two kindes being altogether vaine, carnall and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian: I ſhall have no occaſion to ſpeake of them, except in a way of reproofe, as unprofitable workes of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Civill Worſhip,</hi> Which is an outward expreſſion of reverence and reſpect to men of Authority or eminency, * this being in its own ſphere lawfull, being bounded by the law of God. I ſhall have little occaſion to ſpeake of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Divine or Spirituall Worſhip,</hi> that is, When the true God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped after a true manner; which worſhip we may fitly deſcribe to be, The ſubjection of the whole man unto God, in every thing commanded by God, from a true underſtanding of God, by the power of God, with ſingular ſpirituality, faith, reverence, feare, and love, in obedience unto God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this deſcription there are ſeverall things to be minded, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required in all true worſhippers of God; As</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Spirituall</hi> principle, whereby we come to a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
               <p>Firſt, of God, the object of divine worſhip; The inſcription of the Saints Altar is not to an unknowne God, but to him whom they underſtand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wherein the worſhip of God doth conſiſt; Every worſhip will not ſerve the Lord; blind obedience is the ſacrifice of fooles; but that which God approves, his owne light reveales;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117308:11"/> which diſcovers it to conſiſt in ſubjection unto God: where there is true worſhip there muſt be preheminence; where there is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority there is ſuperiority, from whence ſprings ſubjection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Spirituall power, it is not every ſtrength that is able to build this houſe; that which Gods light reveales his power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and effects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The manner how the worſhip of God is to be performed, muſt be regarded: every way of offering the Lord accepts not, but he will be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Firſt, with ſingular ſpirituality, as the object, principle and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are all ſpirituall, ſo muſt the heart be, offering up Sacrifices in a ſpirituall manner; it is the ſpirit in all performances that makes them truly lovely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in faith; a ſoule that worſhips God muſt beleive God and give credit to the words of God,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in feare and reverence; the Majeſty of God commands reverence in all that come before his Throne; That infiniteneſſe and unſpeakableneſſe of glory that is in the Lord, cauſes a ſoule to fall downe before him even at his feet, adoring him, crying out with <hi>Iſaiah, I am undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in love; no ſervice without love is acceptable; if the diſtance was onely minded, it would ſtrike ſuch amazement and terrour, that none would dare to come to God. Therefore the Lord ſends from the brightneſſe of his Majeſty comfortable beames and raies of love, to gather up the ſoule to himſelf; through the power of which, the ſoule is fired with love, and flaming in this chariot, mounts up to God; accounting the hardeſt enterpriſe he can atcheive for God, to be his greateſt honour.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Divine Worſhip in all its going forth to God, makes its addreſſes in the Lord Jeſus: Spirituall and Goſpell-Worſhippers receive all from God in Chriſt, returne all to God in him; who is that way in which God and the Soule meet embracing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who is that Ladder on which God deſcends to him, and he aſcends to God; he loves, feares, ſerves and lives to God in Chriſt, and in him alone.</p>
               <p>This true worſhip of God appeares in a twofold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inviſibly; which is onely in the inward man, in the ſpirit which no man ſees or knowes, but he in whom it dwels.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117308:11"/>2. Viſibly; which others may take notice of, whereby an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible enjoyment and filiall affections are clearely demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>I ſhall handle the firſt of theſe in the firſt part of this diſcourſe, namely the inviſible worſhip of God; and the laſt, <hi>viz:</hi> the viſible in the laſt part.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>Chap. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Sheweth what the Spirituall principle in true worſhipping is, whereby we come to know God; and what of God may be knowne to the Saints.</head>
               <p>PRinciples are ſo requiſite to all manner of actions, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done regularly or honourably without them. A true principle is that which crownes every act; if a man be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in his principles, all his building will prove but rotten.</p>
               <p>By this ſpirituall principle, I meane a ſure ground, or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <note place="margin">What the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is.</note> ſeated in the heart by the Lord, whereby the Soule aſcends to the true worſhip of God. And this is two-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Light. Till the Sun of righteouſneſſe ſhines into the Soule, to <note place="margin">It is light.</note> diſcover the minde and will of God, the duty and priviledge of his creature, the Soule is a darke dungeon, a ſleepy dead confuſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; but when God comes in the appearance of Himſelfe, the Soule is enlightened. Which light is <note place="margin">Light comes from God.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sent forth from the Lord, 'tis a ſpirituall, divine, ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light. <hi>In thy light</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſhall wee ſee light;</hi> Tis not in the light of the World, or of the firſt Creation, but a new light to him, that he had not knew not, nor enjoyed before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſent into the Soule, as the light of the Sunne is conveyed to the naturall eye, whereby that diſcernes naturall objects: ſo is <note place="margin">Light dwels in the ſoule.</note> the heavenly light darted into the ſpirit of a man, whereby that man being in this light, ſeeth it, and nothing ſpiritually without it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Love, love unto God, and the truth and light of God, though a man may know much even by the true light; yet if love be not <note place="margin">It is love.</note>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117308:12"/> one with the light, that is to ſay, if love and light walke not hand in hand, the Soule worſhips not God aright; therefore as we heare the Saints breathing out their deſires to the Lord that he would ſend forth his light and his truth, to leade them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his Altar, that is to ſay, to worſhip God. So likewiſe we heare of receiving truth in the love of it. If I know any thing, and yet love it not, I cannot chearefully entertaine or embrace it. Love, love I ſay unto the Lord, produced by the light and love of God, both implanted in the heart become that ſpirituall principle that carries forth the Soule certainly unto God.</p>
               <p>We are to conſider this ſpirituall <hi>principle</hi> with its object: light <note place="margin">God is the true object of the Saints light and love</note> and love are vaine, empty, a meere fancy without a ſutable object. The object of true light and ſpirituall love is, that God which is to be worſhipped: God over all, God in all, God above all, which light diſcovers what of God is to be knowne by the Saints, and wherein the appearances of God are.</p>
               <p>The Light of God reveales this to the Soule, <hi>that God is.</hi> Hearken what the eternall Spirit ſaith in the Scriptures: He <hi>that comes to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">That God is.</note> 
                  <hi>God muſt firſt believe that God is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage: he bids <hi>Moſes Goe and ſay, I am hath hath ſent you,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſignifies to them his being, that he is, diſtinguiſhing himſelfe from heatheniſh vanities, he is in himſelfe and of himſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God frequently ſtiles himſelfe by the name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he points out to us his being in a moſt excellent manner: Gods being is himſelfe from eternity, the ſame without <hi>diminution, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtraction.</hi> Though <hi>the foole ſaith in his heart there is no God;</hi> and the voluptuous man makes: his <hi>belly and pleaſure his God:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the world makes <hi>Satan the Prince of the world their God:</hi> Yet God onely is, <hi>viz:</hi> that <hi>unſpeakable ſubſtance</hi> who lives of himſelfe, what all creatures are, they are by God, and have their dependance upon God; but God himſelfe is onely truly <hi>Independent.</hi>

               <p>To anſwer this, we muſt conſider to know God is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To know that there is a God, or that this God is; and ſo if we know him not, we cannot ſpeak of him nor live to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To know God, is to know him after a ſort or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi> As he hath revealed himſelf to the Sons of men; for the <hi>incomprehenſible being:</hi> and <hi>inviſible Beer,</hi> hath made himſelf viſible after a ſort, ſo that our obedience may not be without knowledge, nor our eyes without an object; and ſo if thou art made partaker of the Spirit, and ſo dwelleſt in the <hi>light of God,</hi> thou mayeſt ſee him,</p>

               <p>Secondly, That he is <hi>Immutable;</hi> the World is poſſeſt with <note place="margin">God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable.</note> 
                  <hi>changes, But in him there is no ſhadow of Change:</hi> The World growes old as doth a garment: <hi>But he is the ſame yeſterday and to day, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> this is the record he gives of himſelf ſaying, <hi>I the Lord, I change not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mutability proceeds from <hi>corruption or imbecillity:</hi> but <hi>GODS</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moſt <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> there is no compoſition in him; neither is he ſubjected to <hi>time</hi> in which all changes are.</p>

                  <hi>Moſes ſaw the face of God,</hi> and yet ſaith God to <hi>Moſes, my face cannot be ſeen.</hi> The <hi>face of God</hi> is a phraſe God uſeth, deſcending to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of Gods creatures whereby the Lord holds forth ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of himſelf. <hi>Moſes ſeeing Gods face,</hi> was his ſeeing the full eſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods beauty and minde that was then for him to ſee; (for the face demonſtrates the beauty and minde of a man) and yet he ſaw not his <hi>being.</hi> The face of God doth there hold forth no more the being of God, then the face of a man his being: a mans beauty is not his being; for a man is a man, though he be not beautifull.</p>
               <p>And when as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>be ſhall ſee God,</hi> his meaning is he ſhall ſee what of God may be ſeen; for he that is in himſelfe inviſible, makes himſelf viſible after a ſort: <hi>viz</hi> by the appearance of his love and glory in his Son: therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>No man hath ſeen the Father at any time, but the only begotten Son hath declared him.</hi> We hear many declarations of God, which is the fight of of God the creature hath: which declarations <hi>define</hi> not his being, but <hi>deſcribe</hi> his operations: thus is it ſaid, <hi>God came downe in the ſight of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael,</hi> when they only ſaw ſome terrible appearances of his majeſty and authority.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Almightines of God may be ſeen by the Creature;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117308:13"/> that he is over all and above all, and can doe what he will, is very evident: all power centers in him as its true originall: this omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of God is immutable, boundleſſe and infinite: Who ſhall ſay to him, this is too hard for thee?</p>
               <p>This power, even this Almighty power, which the ſervants of the Lord feele and know, through its irreſiſtible operations enforces them to ſerve him with feare, and rejoyce before him with trembling.</p>
               <p>6. Gods ſoveraignty and ſupremacy is likewiſe through the <note place="margin">Gods ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty may be knowne.</note> light of God clearely made manifeſt; that is to ſay, that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; the principall, chiefe and worthieſt of all; and under this conſideration may be known to the Sons of men; he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. This is that which begets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; children obey and honour their parents as them that are over them; ſervants their maſters; ſubjects their Kings and rulers, as them that are their ſuperiours; and ſo Creatures the Creator, as being more worthy then all: his power and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are inſeparable companions; his power fils him with majeſty and authority.</p>
               <p>7. The wiſedome of God may be known, that is to ſay, that he is <note place="margin">The light of God diſcovers the wiſedome of God.</note> wiſe, underſtanding, knowing all things; by wiſedome he governes all things; by wiſedome he made and <hi>garniſhed the heavens;</hi> power, authority, and all without wiſedome, act confuſedly. Therefore is he called, <hi>the everlaſting light,</hi> and <hi>the Father of light, the God of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> he is wiſe ſupereminently, and therefore called <hi>the onely wiſe God,</hi> Rom. 16. 27.</p>
               <p>8. God is a juſt God, and his Saints know him to be ſo: Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <note place="margin">Gods Juſtice may be knowne, and what it is.</note> is his righteous diſpenſation of love or wrath, according to his owne law made after his owne will; and thus he is juſt or righteous to the Creature, and he is alſo juſt and righteous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: a God of more pure eyes then to behold iniquity, and of more juſtice then to ſuffer it to paſſe unpuniſhed. This makes a poore ſoule bow his knees and tremble before Gods dreadfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: who can approach Gods preſence without feare? and for this cauſe is he called a <hi>God of vengeance,</hi> a <hi>Conſuming fire,</hi> the <hi>Judge of all the earth, a Judge, moſt juſt,</hi> Job 37. 17. He is moſt faithfull, <hi>he cannot lye, he is a true God, a God of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. That God is mercifull, gracious, full of loving kindneſſe, flow to anger, whoſe mercies are above all his workes; his mercy <note place="margin">God is mercifull.</note> and his juſtice kiſſe each other. This conſideration begets liberty,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117308:14"/> freedome and boldneſſe in the ſpirit, to ſerve, feare, honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lord. In this ſenſe is he called, <hi>a father of mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 3. This is diſcovered to a Soule as the argument for a Soules obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God: <hi>If yee love mee, keepe my commands:</hi> For we love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</p>
               <p>10. God is nearly related to the creature. Though God be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">God is known to be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the creature.</note> ſo glorious and excellent, yet if he had no relation to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would contribute nothing towards ſpirituall worſhip: which relation is made manifeſt in ſeverall particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is a Creator; and all things are his creatures, they are all his workmanſhip, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 28. In the beginning God made the world, and all things in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is a Father; All things are begotten by him, In him we live, and move, and have our being.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is a Husband; <hi>that eſpouſes Soules to Himſelfe,</hi> Iſaiah 54. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A King, and we his Subjects; He <hi>rules over all the earth, and the ſea is his dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might here ſhew at large, how the ſeverall tearmes God gives to himſelfe, hold forth his relation to the ſons of men: but I ſhall not now inſiſt upon them. <note place="margin">God is all in all.</note>
               </p>
               <p>11. God is revealed to be all in all, that is to ſay, in his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or workes; There are diverſities (ſaith the Spirit) of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but <hi>it is the ſame God that worketh all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 6 All thats good or excellent, beautifull or glorious in all or any Creature, proceeds from God; and this ſhewes the creatures dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; therefore is he ſaid <hi>to fill all in all,</hi> Eph. 1. 23. That is to ſay, All fulneſſe in any creature is from the Lord; who is above <hi>all, ruling over us through all, manifeſting his power and wiſedome in us all, dwelling in us, abiding and delighting in us,</hi> Eph. 4. 6. <note place="margin">God is one.</note>
               </p>
               <p>12. This God is one infinite being: There are Gods many, and Lords many, but to us there is but one God. Many men are called Gods: It is written, <hi>I have ſaid yee are Gods:</hi> but there is one origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall being, who is our God in the Lord Jeſus; there are not many firſt beings, but one originall, who is the firſt and the laſt, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the ending: that is to ſay, the firſt in himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, ſubſiſting by himſelfe, giving a beginning to all, and the laſt, continuing in himſelfe for ever, putting an end to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things by himſelfe, for he is without beginning or end of dayes.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117308:14"/>
               <p>13. God is a living God, he is not a dumbe or deafe Idoll, but one that lives for ever: Time moulders all Idols in the duſt; but <note place="margin">God is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</note> God is not ſubject to time: this infinite being cannot dye, that is to ſay, be ſubject to diſſolution or corruption.</p>
               <p>14. Laſtly, God is preſent every where, he cannot be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <note place="margin">God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places.</note> for he is an infinite one: thou canſt not ſay, God is not here, for he is every where, knowing all thoughts, ſearching all hearts; if thou canſt tell me where God ceaſes to be, there will I prove to thee God is bounded, limited and finite; which in no ſenſe can be ſaid of the infinite being: his ſpirit and preſence are every where: where ever God is, there he imprints an appearance of himſelfe to be there; if thou goeſt into heaven, that is to ſay, into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of glory, the Pſalmiſt will tell thee, <hi>God is there:</hi> Yea if thou makeſt thy bed in hell, <hi>God is there:</hi> There exerciſing his wrath, juſtice and indignation: If thou thinkeſt to hide thy ſelfe in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the darkneſſe is as light to the Lord: the darkneſſe and the light are alike unto God, that is to ſay, his power, knowledge and wiſedome cannot be ſeparated from any place, or from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any thing. There is ſuch darkneſſe in us that we cannot ſee, but there is no darkneſſe in God, <hi>that ſeeth our darkneſſe by his own light;</hi> Pſalme 139.</p>
               <p>Thus having according to my meaſure brought forth my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what of God may be knowne, <hi>viz.</hi> his power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, light, love, juſtice, preſence, and the like; all which tearms the Lord uſes to expreſſe what he is to us in a way of relation to his creatures, in tearmes that his ſervants are after ſome ſmall meaſure capable to underſtand. I ſhall proceed in the next place to ſhew wherein this excellency of the Lord <hi>Jehovab</hi> our God doth appeare.</p>

               <p>Both theſe are made manifeſt in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Golden pipes</hi> which empty forth the <hi>Golden</hi> uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible <hi>Oyle</hi> of joy, gladneſſe and righteouſneſſe amongſt the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks</hi> into the <hi>Lamps</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> even into the hearts and ſpirits of the <hi>Church of the firſt borne, whoſe names are written in the Lambs book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the two great Ordinances which are diſplayed by the eternall word of God, according to the Scriptures, which are thoſe <hi>Conduite-pipes</hi> which carry in them al that may be ſeen, known, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or enjoyed of God by the Sonnes of men.

The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt naturall capacity may read God in every line of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which ſhewes;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a God; <hi>The inviſible things of him from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Creation ſhews the God-head.</note> 
                  <hi>of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God-head:</hi> Rom. 1. 20. That is to ſay, though God is inviſible, yet that which may be known of him is clearly ſeen; that is underſtood by things that are viſible. Now the thing that may be known is this, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>God-head.</hi> That there is a Divine, Eternall God, is apparent, if we conſider that there is not the leaſt little thing in the whole creation, or great thing, which leadeth us not Step by Step into a GOD-HEAD.</p>
               <p>In this World there are four degrees of things, <hi>viz</hi> which have <hi>being,</hi> which have <hi>life,</hi> which have <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and which have <hi>reaſon;</hi> ſome things have all four; ſome againe only one; yet every one preach forth this God. The Earth, Sea and Aire are very ſpacious, bearing and ſuſtaining all things that have life, ſenſe and reaſon, and yet are themſelves void of life, ſenſe, or reaſon; they are the neareſt to not-being, to annihilation. The Plants beſides being, have life and draw nouriſhment and refreſhment from the earth and aire. The Beaſts have being, life and ſenſe, and ſeeke their food from the earth and plants. Man hath all, being, life, ſenſe and reaſon; he enjoyeth the Elements, feedeth on beaſts and plants, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth other creatures, and diſcourſeth of all things above and below.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117308:15"/> Loe here, this wonderfull order! One thing ſerving another; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is for it ſelfe. From whence comes this diſtribution, one thing ſerving another? Who diſtributes things in this order? From whence had they all their Originall? Whether had they it from themſelves or from another? If from them ſelves, either they had it alwaies, or in time? Alwaies they had it not; for we know, we our ſelves that now are, once were not: and if we had our originall in time, How come we to have it, ſince there was a time when we were not at all? Surely we muſt conclude, the author, original, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and proportioner of all theſe things in ſuch an order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is one that was before us, is above us; which can be no other then God Himſelf.</p>
               <p>Let us deſcend into particulars, and conſider the Elements of which things are compounded, as <hi>fire, earth, aire and water. Fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> are contary, &amp; ſo is the dry to the moiſt: the nature of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is to deſtroy one another: none of theſe two can be coupled without a higher power. Surely this leads us to conſider that great judge and wiſe diſpoſer, that orders things after ſuch a ſtrange manner.</p>
               <p>We ſee very beautifull buildings, ſtately palaces, and our mindes preſently without pauſing upon it ſaith, ſurely here hath bin ſome gallant work-man.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt a <hi>watch</hi> and preſently vieweſt the ballance, then the wheels, and ſo at the laſt comeſt to the ſpring and ſeeſt that moving the <hi>watch,</hi> but yet thou askeſt preſently who made this ſpring, and ſo comeſt to the <hi>watch-maker,</hi> and beholdeſt motion in the <hi>watch</hi> while he that made it moves not at all; thou ſeeſt the Sun move, and muſt needs conclude it hath a firſt mover, and that is none but God: a begining-leſſe and end-leſſe <hi>Beer,</hi> which muſt needs be the very God-head.</p>
               <p>2. So likewiſe, as the world ſhewes there is a God, it ſhews there is but one God; for all things in the world point at unity. <hi>Earth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Creation ſhews that there is but one God.</note> 
                  <hi>water, aire, fire,</hi> are all for to make up on body; all agree in one, though diverſe in them ſelves; all Arts and Sciences move towards unity and congruity: Arithmetique proceeds from unity: Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry from a point, and tends to ſociety and happines and ſollace of man: all Government in Families or Kingdomes reſpect unity: All that ever man doth or can doe leades to a unity, to the high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of one God, and his wiſdome and power: ſurely all theſe unities here below, are but ſo many reſemblances in a fort of the true unity it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117308:16"/>
               <p>The minde of man is one, though It conceives in it an infinite number of things; and the more things are in unity, the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are; then certainly God muſt needs be unity it ſelf, who is truly noble and onely <hi>one.</hi> I might trade far in nature here. But I muſt minde other things likewiſe, ſo that I will not dwel here.</p>
               <p>3. The Creation ſhewes the <hi>almightines</hi> of God in theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt. In <hi>Creating</hi> the World of nothing. Amongſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> its <note place="margin">The creation ſhewes God to be almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> a received <hi>Axiome, Ex nibilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing nothing is made; ſo far as this concernes men its true; which proves the <hi>Almighty</hi> power <hi>of God:</hi> for if man cannot produce the leaſt matter, without ſome pre-exiſtent or foregoing matter to work upon; then ſurely he that can produce the Heavens and the Earth of nothing, muſt needs be very powerfull, yea <hi>Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> as ſaith the Scripture: or theſe Heavens and this Earth, wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> proves the things that now appear, in the beginning had no appearance at all; but were created of nothing; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Reſhith</hi> which is Engliſhed, the <hi>beginning;</hi> doth not ſignifie any ſubſtance. Neither doth the word <hi>Bara,</hi> to Create, ſignifie any other way to create then of nothing; and thereby it is diſtinguiſhed from the word <hi>Jatzar,</hi> to form, and <hi>Gnaſha,</hi> to make; doth not this hold forth the eteruall power of God?</p>
               <p>The World it ſelf ſpeaketh forth this mighty power of God in that it had its beginning from God. If we conſider the ſeverall motions, and mutations that are in the World, we muſt conclude a beginning: Look to the <hi>Rivers,</hi> they flow from the Sea; the Tyde of the Sea, ariſes from the influence of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes light from the Sun. Sometimes Streames grow drie; the <hi>Moon</hi> is ecclipſed. And the Sun continually moves, which argues its beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, but ſay ſome, The Heavens have continued along time and we ſee no</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>change, therefore they were from eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vaine man, becauſe thou ſeeſt no change, therefore will there <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> be no change? Thou ſaiſt it hath continued long, what then? Therefore hath it continued from everlaſting? God that cauſes thee to live it may be twenty, thirty, forty, or ſixty years or more, cauſes that to continue ſome thouſands; wilt thou then argue, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe thou liveſt longer then another, thou ſhalt never dye? Know the World is made for more beſides thee, and they muſt come and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117308:16"/> act their parts in it as wel as thee, and when all are come in, then ſhall it be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>This will appear more plainly, if thou conſidereſt thy own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: ſurely that had a beginning; it was once in the loweſt parts of the Earth, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith; and thou waſt brought forth an <hi>infant of daies,</hi> and greweſt ſtronger in body, and yet for all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to the duſt. Nay, look into thy minde, the moſt Glorious reſemblance of God, and thou wilt finde it had a beginning, for it is ſubject to joy and ſorrow, to learn more and more; which holds forth a beginning, and one that made it, and without it.</p>
               <p>The beginning is the firſt point of <hi>time</hi> and ending the laſt. In the midſt of theſe two points runnes the line of <hi>Time,</hi> which is a little ſpace borrowed from <hi>Eternity;</hi> where God diſplaies his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his viſible <hi>Creation.</hi> That <hi>Eternity</hi> ſhould <hi>create Time</hi> is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de; and that <hi>Time</hi> ſhould again be ſwallowed up of <hi>Eternity</hi> is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In upholding the World to this moment; the World would ſoon be diſſolved, if that boundleſſe power ſupported it not. When the Earth was without <hi>form, and voide, and darkneſſe was upon the face of the waters,</hi> then the <hi>Spirit of God moved</hi> and brooded on them, which did ſupport that matter, and brought it forth into ſo glorious a fabrick as we now behold this day. And if that Spirit or power, moved not ſtill in this fabrick to ſupport it, it would ſoon return into its firſt nothing. Therefore ſaith the <hi>Scripture, All things conſiſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nature it ſelf preaches this; the verieſt <hi>Athieſt</hi> or <hi>Epicure</hi> that is, that when he is well hath no leaſure to think of God, or that he may ſin the more greedily, denies there is a God; when he is never ſolittle ſick, or ready to dye, his conſcience flies in his face and he is forced to acknowledge a God, and that he cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. I have already ſhown the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are ſubject to <hi>mutability,</hi> and ſo capable of diſſolution; and certainly did not <hi>God</hi> keep them by his right-hand, they would come to nothing.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Creation</hi> cries aloud <hi>God</hi> is incomprehenſible. I might here <note place="margin">The creation ſhewes the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſſe of God.</note> fill volume after volume, by deſcending into thouſands of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and ſhew thee every one, every little, yea, the leaſt thing thou canſt ſpeak of leads thee there by the hand to acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>All that any man, the pureſt naturall man or ſpirituall man is, is but the worke of <hi>Gods</hi> hand; now the workman is greater and more worthy then his worke. Thou ſeeſt a curious peece of worke
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117308:17"/> made by a skilfull artiſt, and praiſeſt it: but being led from the worke to the artiſt, thu admireſt the ingenuity and dexterity of the minde of that man from whence the worke proceeds.</p>
               <p>Yet a little further, let us view the workes of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sunne, Moone, Starres, the Hearbs of the Field, the Beaſts of the Forreſt, the Fiſhes in the Sea: Canſt thou tell me what the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of them be? Philoſophers have traded ſo farre and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly herein, that in truth all that they have ſaid of them, or can ſay, is but vanity and confuſion. This puts the wiſeſt of them all to a <hi>non-plus;</hi> hence is it they differ ſo much about them; The wiſeſt muſt confeſſe his knowledge herein to be but ignorance. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, things are <hi>compounded</hi> of the four <hi>Elements. viz.

And that the vertue of many things proceed from the four firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of heat, moiſture, drines and cold: but yet are shey forced to confeſſe many things operate from a hidden or occult quality, which they can render no reaſon of. Aske them why the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> drawes <hi>Iron</hi> to it ſelfe, they ſay, There is a hidden vertue in it, a ſpecifick quality, or a ſimilitude of ſubſtance; but from whence it proceeds they cannot tel. Nay, ask any man in things ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ordinary, as why the fire ſhould burn, rather then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? They ſay it is its proper nature ſo to doe: But where it had this nature, or how it came by it, they are forced to be ſilent, or to acknowledge it from <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf. Surely if we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the leaſt things, as a flie, or the graſſe of the field, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the infinite one. They tell us <hi>Rubarb</hi> purges <hi>Choler &amp;c.</hi> from a hidden quality; which hidden quality indeed is nothing elſe then the very inſtinct of the <hi>Creator</hi> in it.</p>

               <p>5. The Creation lively <hi>points</hi> out to us the wiſedome of God. If <note place="margin">The Creation ſhewes Gods wiſedome.</note> thou ſeeſt the <hi>picture</hi> of a man, thou preſently askeſt who made it, and admireſt his skill and cunning; if thou caſteth but a <hi>glimpſe</hi> of thy eyes on the world, and askeſt who made it, thou wilt ſee it is God, and wilt admire his wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Gods wiſedome appeares in that glorious and harmonious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is in the world, that unity ſhould be produced from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety. Oh what a wonder is it! I have told thee before, fire and water be contrary, ſo drineſſe and moiſture, yet thy one body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without them all, being compoſed of them all; nay let me tell thee, it is God keepes them from encroaching one upon the other; there is not one thing in the Creation but be-ſpeakes God to be a wiſe God. Thou knoweſt of beaſts, ſome are for thy food, and ſome againe would devoure thee; thoſe that are for thy uſe, God hath placed nigh thee in flocks and herds; thoſe that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117308:18"/> would devoure thee live in deſert places, in the wilderneſſe, in caves and dens. From whence came this diſpoſall of them? did thy own wiſedome procure it? No certainly; tis no other thing then the wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p>6. The love and relation God hath to the Sons of men appears <note place="margin">The Creation ſhewes the love of God.</note> in the Creation. It may be thou art a Father of Children, thou provideſt for them food and raiment, and why? Becauſe thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them. God created all for man. God firſt made the World, and brought man into it as into a large <hi>Pallace,</hi> ready furniſhed with all things fit for delight, pleaſure and food, that man became Lord of the <hi>Creatures;</hi> all things were made for man, and man for God, in whom he took delight; As for man he created him <hi>in his own Image,</hi> wherein appears his great <hi>love:</hi> to be created in his <hi>Image,</hi> was to be made ſuch a <hi>Creature,</hi> that in an eſpeciall manner, did moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <note place="margin">What 'tis to be created in Gods Image.</note> his Maker in a created pure natural light and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, power and authority, whereby he was the <hi>Image</hi> or likenes of God. I might further ſhew that the <hi>Creation</hi> holds forth the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of God; for he that made all <hi>changes</hi> muſt needs be <hi>unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable;</hi> and the <hi>Soveraignity</hi> of GOD; for he that made all muſt needs be <hi>Lord of all;</hi> and the <hi>Eternity</hi> of GOD: for he that made time muſt needs be before time; and the life of God, for he that made all creatures live, muſt needs live himſelfe; the juſtice of God, that ordaines it to be obſerved in his creatures, muſt needs be juſt in himſelfe; yea of the inviſibility of God; for if thou canſt not ſee into the ſubſtances of things made by him, thou canſt not ſee him that made them. I might ſhew you that God is all in all in the creation, that is to ſay, there is nothing without him, and all things that it is it is by him: but becauſe I ſhal further have occaſion to hold forth the excellency of the Lord to the Creature in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond particular, <hi>viz:</hi> as he appeares in the Lord Jeſus. I paſſe from the firſt Creation, the habitation of the firſt man, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, which is earthly, unto the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſecond man, the Lord from heaven and his generation, the children of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and new Creation; concluding this Chapter with this, that what I have already ſaid of God is not to define what he is, but to tell us what he is not, that we may not deceive our ſelves by our proud and vaine apprehenſions, in forming a God to our ſelves; either with the ignorant, thinking him to be a huge body, or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſubſtance; or with other that ſeeme to be wiſe, dreame of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him; but rather ſay at firſt, <hi>he is that he is,</hi> but what I

I ſhall endeavour to ſpeake more plainely and particularly of it. and ſhall obſerve this order:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew what we are to underſtand by God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How God in Chriſt unvailes himſelfe to the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>That we may know what we are to underſtand by God in Chriſt, theſe three things are to be conſidered, and that from the word Chriſt, which ſignifies one Anointed; wherein conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Anointer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Anointed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Ointment it ſelfe wherewith he his anointed. Of theſe in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Anointer, giver, diſpenſer or pourer forth of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">who is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointer; 'tis the Father.</note> is the Father; God in all, over all, and above all, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things; tis that infinite, that incomprehenſible majeſty, that eternall ſubſtance which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved to be incomprehenſible. The Scriptures abound in this doctrine. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord God is upon me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 61. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>hath anointed me.</hi> God proclaimes it from heaven, ſaying, <hi>I have found my ſervant David,</hi> (which is the Lord Chriſt) <hi>with my holy oile I have anointed him.</hi> Againe ſingeth the ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael in the Song
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117308:19"/> that his heart <hi>endited</hi> or <hi>bubled</hi> or <hi>boyled</hi> forth concerning the King; <hi>God thy God hath anointed thee;</hi> This was prefigured, ſhadowed, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, and typed forth in the Law, by <hi>Moſes</hi> anointing <hi>Aaron.</hi> This is the Fathers worke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſubject Anointed is the humane nature in which <note place="margin">The ſubject Anointed is the humane nature.</note> God was manifeſted; for he was manifeſted in the fleſh: It was that particular body of Chriſt, that <hi>the word dwelt in; which was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us:</hi> and therefore ſaith the Scripture, he hath A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <hi>his holy childe Jeſus,</hi> even <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> the <hi>ſon of Mary;</hi> of <note place="margin">Acts 4. 27.</note> a <hi>Virgin:</hi> the <hi>Son of David, the Son of Abraham, the Son of Man;</hi> who is called, <hi>The man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> It was that particular perſon who was the ſubject of this <hi>anointing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>humane nature</hi> is nothing elſe but a <hi>fleſhly body,</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul</hi> united in one; which <hi>humanity</hi> is proper to all men, yet ſo that every man hath the whole <hi>humane nature</hi> in himſelf: and ſo was this perſon, this man Chriſt, this <hi>humane nature</hi> conſiſting of body and ſpirit in one perſon, was the Subject of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Ointment</hi> it ſelf remains to be declared, which is <note place="margin">Theointment is the Spirit.</note> that <hi>holy Oyle</hi> with which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is <hi>Anointed;</hi> which <hi>Ointment</hi> hath ſeverall names in Scripture to declare its worth and nature. It is the Spirit of God, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 98. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>me, he hath anointed me. With my holy Oyle,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him;</hi> which is the <hi>Oyle</hi> of joy and gladneſſe, the holy Ghoſt and power: Which <hi>Oyle</hi> is ſweetly tipified forth to us by the <hi>holy Oyle</hi> mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe compoſition conſiſts of principall <hi>ſpices,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ex. 30. 25. 30.</note> as pure <hi>Mirrbe,</hi> ſweet <hi>Calamus,</hi> ſweet <hi>Cynnamon, Caſſia and Oyle olive;</hi> wherein, though miſteriouſly, yet very excellently is <hi>deciphered</hi> the very nature of the Sprtit of the Lord Jeſus: for the nature of that compoſition is ſuch, that it is of ſinguler vertue, being ſoveraign for the <hi>brain,</hi> comfortable for the <hi>heart,</hi> and wholſome for the <hi>liver,</hi> the three natural fountains and ſprings of the naturall bodies life, purging from evil humors, mollifying and ſoftning the body, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the body to performe its <hi>naturall, vitall</hi> and <hi>animall</hi> faculties: Which is abundantly, yea, ſuperlatively true of the Spirit, that gives to a Saint being, wiſdome, underſtanding, light, life, power, love and increaſe to a Saint; ſoftning the hardeſt heart, moiſtening and relenting the moſt flinty ſpirit; purging and ſcouring away ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually all droſſy, cholerick, paſſionate, idle, melancholy, earthly and evill humors of ſin and corruption; fitting and enabling the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117308:19"/> ſoule, to runne the waies of Gods commands; preſerving the ſoule from ſins venome and poiſon; keeping it from corruption or putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And wheras none was permitted to make any <hi>after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that compoſition,</hi> It declares and proclaimes aloud the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the true Spirit to all pretences of it, or counterfeitings of it, which are the <hi>powers, ſignes and lying wonders of the man of ſinne,</hi> which Chriſt, through the <hi>brightneſſe of his coming,</hi> will deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly have I handled the three eſſential things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the true knowledge of God in Chriſt. Now know this, That neither of theſe three, abſtracted from the other, is the Lords Chriſt; tis the <hi>compoſition</hi> or <hi>conjunction</hi> of theſe three in one perſon, that makes this Chriſt; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The word was with GOD, and was GOD;</hi> and yet <hi>was made fleſh:</hi> which leads us to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the various manifeſtations of God, as they are one in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are three that beare Record in heaven, the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt</hi> or Spirit, <hi>and theſe three are one; viz</hi> One God and one in the <hi>man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three are not three Gods, but one. God is made manifeſt <note place="margin">What the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit are.</note> after three manner of wayes, that is to ſay, God the Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his word in his owne minde, which is his ſonne, eternally brought up with him; his wiſedome, daily his delight; it is his light whereby he knowes himſelfe, and brings forth every thing by himſelfe. For by his word, that is to ſay, himſelfe in a way of activity, or doing, or wiſedome, made the worlds: the word was in himſelfe producing every thing below himſelfe, and the ſpirit is the mutuall kindneſſe each of other, which is actively eternall. The ſpirit is ſometimes taken for the power of God, ſuſteining all things, producing all things: ſometimes for the influence of the Fathers love ſhed abroad in the heart: and this is the Spirit of God, the Comforter in the Goſpell; ſo that all theſe are one, agree in one; and what may be attributed to the one, doth agree to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; So that theſe three are not three diſtinct ſubſtances or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the common and moſt knowne acceptation of the word, <hi>viz:</hi> a particular and individuall ſubſtance or being, diſtinct from another. In this ſenſe I ſay, there are not three perſons in God, for this is to make three Gods; but becauſe the Scriptures no where ſaith there are three perſons, I hope the word (invented by mans wiſedome) ſhall not be impoſed on any as a ſnare: let us more look to things then words. I ſay according to the Scriptures, there are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117308:20"/> three that beare Record in Heaven: the Father, <hi>viz:</hi> the infinite being, the begetter of the Son: and the Son, <hi>viz:</hi> the expreſſe image of God, the reflection or likeneſſe of himſelfe, which is the word begotten of the Father; and the ſpirit the mutuall kindneſſe, love, and communication of the Father and the Son; for God is love: all agree in one, in one man Chriſt Jeſus, the Father is in him, the Word is in him, <hi>for it was made fleſh, and dwelt among us;</hi> and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in him, <hi>viz:</hi> the eternall love of the Father, the ſweet and heavenly influences thereof; it is given to him without meaſure, So that God manifeſted in the fleſh in a way of union is Chriſt; for all that may be knowne, or underſtood, or enjoyed of God, is in the Lord Jeſus. Nay further; what ever God is to a Saint, he is it in Chriſt Jeſus, for the fulneſſe of the God-head dwelt in him bodily, that is to ſay, God in his higheſt manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in power, grace and truth, &amp;c. For he was full of grace and truth.</p>
               <p>The ſum of what I have ſaid or can ſay in this particular (which notwithſtanding I muſt confeſſe comes infinitely ſhort of the height of its glory) is that the conjunction of Father, Son and Spirit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpiritual and wonderfull manner, in the man Jeſus Chriſt, is the <hi>Lords Chriſt.</hi> So that God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is God the Father dwelling in, and uniting the <hi>humane nature</hi> after a <hi>wonderfull and unſpeakable</hi> manner to himſelfe; and therefore is Chriſt called God and Man: and becauſe of this union, Chriſt ſometimes ſpeaks as he is man, and ſo dies; ſometimes as the Word, which is God in him, and ſo he raiſeth himſelf from the dead, ſometimes in a way of union, and ſo he is the <hi>Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>HAving ſhewed what we are to underſtand by God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and what the Lords Chriſt is; I am come now to ſhew, that Chriſt was not <hi>anointed</hi> for himſelf only, but that he might communicate of his fulneſſe to others: which appeares in theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated</hi> to a glorious work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made fit, capable and able effectually to performe whatever worke was impoſed on him, which his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anointed holds forth to us: Of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>In Chriſt's deſignation to a worke, there are two things to be obſerved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What the worke is that Chriſt is conſecrated to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The manner of his conſecration.</p>
               <p>Concerning the worke it ſelfe, it is a three-fold office or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>viz:</hi> a Prieſtly, Propheticall, and Kingly office, wherein all the appearance of the love, wiſedome or power of God, are clearly made manifeſt. I ſhall ſpeake of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>Now the Prieſthood of Chriſt is that order or office that Chriſt <note place="margin">What the Prieſthood of Chriſt is.</note> hath from his Father, in a way of relation to God and Man offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſacrifices to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Wherein are two things conſiderable:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Sacrifice be offers:</hi> For he is not a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his offering of Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prieſt</hi> is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even the man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Chriſt is the Saints higheſt Prieſt.</note> diſcovered to be the anointed of the Father; even this man that that an unchangable <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> who is the Son of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divine nature, and humane nature; it is he that is our <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prieſts</hi> of old were made without an oath; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> with an oath, by him that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever:</hi> As if God ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Son, its true, there have beene many Prieſts that I have made, but they are dying Prieſts, and their Prieſthood is but a ſhadow or type of thine which I commit to thee; for thou art my well-beloved, and ſhalt not dye, of thy Prieſthood there ſhall be no end; for I have ſaid, yea I have ſworne it, and cannot lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prieſts of old</hi> were conſecrated by the powring Oyle on their heads, and the putting on of the <hi>holy garments:</hi> ſo our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carted by the powring on of oile.</note> was ſet a part for this office by that holy <hi>Oyntment,</hi> even the <hi>power and Spirit of the moſt high,</hi> by the voice from the moſt excellent glory, that gave this Record of him, <hi>This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> miniſters in the Sanctuary with the oyle of joy, gladneſſe, and acceptation powred on him, with the garments of righteouſneſſe and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aaron and his Sons had garments, yea holy garments for glory and for beauty;</hi> which garments were moſt exquiſitely made for workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 2. 3.</note> wiſe-hearted men filled with wiſedome by the Lord, being onely appointed to make them. Whoſe compoſition was of the moſt beautifull, glorious and rich materials, <hi>gold, purple, ſcarlet</hi> and <hi>fine linnen;</hi> which excellently type forth the glory of our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> who ſtands before God in rich, pure, ſpotleſſe, bright, ſhining, and incorruptible garments, being filled, covered and cloathed with the glory of God, and being adorned with the beauty of the moſt High; for he was, and is the expreſſe image of his Fathers beauty. <hi>Aaron</hi> was appointed to beare the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon the <hi>Ephod</hi> upon his Shoulder, and upon the <hi>Breaſtplate</hi> of judgement, upon his heart, engraven in precious ſtones; which ſhewes that our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> the Lord Jeſus, adminiſters before the Lord, with all his Saints engraven upon his heart, in beauty and glory. Thus briefly having taken a view of the manner of our Jeſus his conſecration to his office, let us by divine aſſiſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:117308:22"/>
               <p>The ability to mannage that office; the worke being of ſuch an infinite extent, requires a perſon of anſwerable abilities: which we ſhall eaſily finde to be in the Lord Jeſus, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The dignity of his perſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The excellency of his endowments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, it will appeare, if we conſider that he is the Sonne of God, one begotten of the Father, yea, the delight of the Lord; he is the firſt borne among many brethren. Prieſts of old were of the firſt borne among the family; ſo is our Jeſus the beginning of the Creation of God; the firſt borne from the dead; the onely begotten Son, that is to ſay, the Chiefe; none begotten to be a Saviour, an everlaſting Deliverer of his brethren, beſides himſelfe; he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt, begotten in his Fathers likeneſſe; the expreſſe image of his Fathers perſon; <hi>White and ruddy</hi> (as ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, or thouſand thouſands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the excellency of his qualifications, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, His relation to God; he was the Son of God; and to man, <hi>he was made fleſh;</hi> he was of ſuch a nature, that he ſtood rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to God and man, as he knew how to preſerve both the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the happineſſe of the creature, that ſo divine juſtice might be compleatly ſatisfied, and mercy admirably advanced in the creatures ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His intereſt in God and man; he was not onely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, but had a deepe intereſt in them both: To God he was a Companion, therefore God cals him, <hi>the man his fellow. Moſes</hi> of old was prevalent with God, but our Jeſus much more. <hi>Moſes</hi> as a ſervant, Jeſus as a ſon and heire; to Man as a faithfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friend, yea companion, and fellow ſufferer; <hi>he was tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour us being tempted.</hi> Likewiſe he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beloved, whom God can deny nothing; to the Saints advocate that will loſe nothing for want of asking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His will, power, love, wiſedome and delight, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Chriſts will, power and love concurre in it.</note> in fitting him to be ſuch a Prieſt; his love ſets all on worke, both power and wiſedome; he is the power of God and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is without ſpot or blemiſh; the Prieſts of old <note place="margin">He is without ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. Heb. 4. 15.</note> were forced to offer for their owne ſinnes daily, but our Jeſus had no ſinne to offer for: <hi>He was like to us in all things, ſinne onely excepted.</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117308:23"/> There <hi>was no guile found in his mouth.</hi> Yea, ſuch an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> became <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26. 25.</note> us, <hi>who is holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeperate from ſinners, made higher then the heavens, able to ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was a <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of an Incorruptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Chriſt is of an incorruptible nature.</note> one that continueth for ever. The <hi>High Prieſts</hi> under the Law by reaſon of death continued not; but Jeſus is a <hi>High Prieſt for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchiſedeck:</hi> that is to ſay, without Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he was not of the off-ſpring of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but of <hi>Judah;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or end of dayes, who ever liveth to intercede for us.

               <p>Firſt, The Sacrifice it ſelfe is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. When burnt offerings and ſacrifices God would not, Chriſt came to do his will. This is held forth to us in the Scriptures by ſeverall expreſſions; all centring in one thing, namely, In this ſacrifice, as firſt, by giving himſelfe; as ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Who gave himſelfe for our ſinnes.</hi> Againe ſaith <hi>Paul, Who hath loved us, and given himſelfe for us</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:117308:23"/> 
                  <hi>an offering and a ſacrifice to God.</hi> The Prieſts of old offered goats and lambs, and the like, but our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> a better ſacrifice, even himſelfe:</p>
               <p>Secondly, By powring out his bloud, all things almoſt under the <note place="margin">Tis Chriſts bloud.</note> Law were ſprinkled and purified with bloud, for without bloud there was no remiſſion; the patterns of things in the heavens were purged with the bloud of buls and goates, but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices, namely, with the <hi>bloud of Chriſt himſelfe. The bloud of beaſts ſprinkled upon the uncleane, ſanctified to</hi>

                  <hi>the purifying of the fleſh;</hi> but Chriſt's bloud was the <hi>Sacrifice for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the heavenly things, viz:</hi> the Saints bodies and ſpirits. To this the Scripture gives a large Record; <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>even the bloud of the croſſe, that bloud that iſſued forth frow the ſide of our Jeſus, whom one of the Souldiers peirced.</hi> The High Prieſt under the Law went into the ſecond Tabernacle once every yeare, not without bloud, which he <hi>offered for himſelfe and the errours of the people:</hi> but our Chriſt entred into the moſt holy place <hi>by his owne bloud,</hi> which is called <hi>the bloud of ſprinkling, which Chriſt pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth when he ſuffered without the gate, even his owne precious bloud, which is the bloud of God. This is he that came by water and bloud, even Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This was part of that new Song the 24 Elders ſang, when they fell <hi>downe before the Lambe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by thy bloud:</hi> even his <hi>bloud whoſe veſture was dipt in bloud.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts bloud is called, the <hi>bloud of the Covenant: of the everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome will be ready to ſay, who ſeeme to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> ſpirituall, <hi>That, that bloud that waſhes us, is not the bloud poured forth upon the Croſſe; for that was ſpilt upon the ground, but it is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bloud;</hi> and therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that eateth my body, and drinketh my bloud ſhall never dye:</hi> which ſeemes to imply ſome other bloud. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the bloud of Chriſt we are to underſtand, not onely the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> bloud ſned forth from his ſide, as a naturall eye might ſee it, but the ſame bloud in the virtue of it, which bloud is the ſacrifice. So he that drinketh Chriſts bloud partakes of the excellent benefit that redounds through Chriſts bloud, which in due time I ſhall ſhew you more fully.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this word <hi>Bloud,</hi> we muſt know the death of Chriſt to be concluded, and his body included. All Chriſts ſuffering center in one word, namely, his <hi>Bloud,</hi> which holds forth all his ſufferings upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117308:24"/> the Croſſe: And therefore in the next place the Scripture declares this ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be the offering up of his body, <hi>Chriſt gave up his body to death, to ſuffer all the wrath of man, and to become an offering for ſinne:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">It is his body Heb. 10. 10. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Col. 1. 22. Iſa. 33. 10. John 10. 15. Acts 8. 53. 1 John 13. 16. Matth. 20. 28.</note> it is called <hi>the offering of the body of Christ.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Peter, he bare our ſinnes in his owne body, even in the body of his fleſh.</hi> By which body we are to underſtand <hi>himſelfe,</hi> his <hi>bloud:</hi> for every one of theſe words are wound interchangably each in other. Thus Chriſt gives his body to be eaten, that is to ſay, the fruit of the offering up his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; he gives his body for us that the fruit of that body might redound to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is ſaid, <hi>He made his ſoule an offering for ſinne.</hi> The Lord Chriſt <note place="margin">It is his ſoule offered up.</note> offered up the whole man, body and ſpirit; he loved not his life, but poured forth his ſoule, and underwent the whole curſe, wrath and vengeance of the moſt High in body and ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt ſayes, <hi>he layes downe his life for us,</hi> yea, <hi>he gave his life a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe his life. Rom. 5. 10. Col. 1. 22. Heb. 2. 9. 14. Heb. 9. 15. 1 Pet. 13. 18. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>ranſome for many.</hi> In this word all the other are contained.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſo often ſaid in the Scriptures, <hi>we are ſaved by his death, and by his ſufferings.</hi> So that all theſe tearmes of Chriſt giving himſelfe, pouring forth his bloud, giving his owne body, making his ſoule an offering for ſin, laying downe his life, dying and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us, are all one ſacrifice; one is diffuſed into all, and all center in every one.</p>

               <p>1. How often this ſacrifice was offered. The Prieſts under the Law <note place="margin">How often this Sacrifice was offered. Heb. 9. 26. 28. Heb. 10. 10. 12. 14. 18.</note> went into the holy place every year, they offered ſacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; But our <hi>Jeſus by one ſacrifice hath done away ſinne.</hi> The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of the legall ſacrifices argued their imperfection; for thoſe Prieſts daily miniſtring, offered ſometimes the ſame ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which could never take away ſinne; but this <hi>Man,</hi> ſaith the Spirit, <hi>after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, for ever ſate downe on the</hi>

                  <hi>right hand of God,</hi> holding forth the worke was done that Chriſt might ſit ſtill, needing no more offering; And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>He ſat down on Gods right hand,</hi> it declares he had done his worke, and the Father accepted it; or elſe he ſhould never have beene placed in the throne of victory, at his Fathers right hand. Chriſt was <hi>once,</hi> (and but <hi>once) offered to beare the ſinnes of many.</hi> Many talke of Chriſts dying ſtill in us, and the like, but indeed inſtead of exalting Chriſt (as they pretend to do) they ranke him onely in the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Prieſthood, and inſtead of holding forth his perfection, they render him imperfect, and quite contradict the aforenamed Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>place</hi> where Chriſt was offered deſerves our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is not ſaid in vaine, <hi>that he ſuffered without the gate upon the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The place where this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Heb. 13. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and that betweene two theeves, it ſhewes the deſcenſion of our Saviour into the loweſt, vileſt, contemptibleſt eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that could be. Chriſt died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City, not in the heart: but in <hi>Judea</hi> in the world. I mind this the rather, becauſe ſome think the death of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> not at all to concerne them, but they look for Chriſts death within them, whereas in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nothing is more cleare then this, that Chriſts death at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is the offering for ſin, not Chriſts death in any ones heart; The Scriptures warrant no ſuch kinde of language; I confeſſe I know thus much, that though Chriſt died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, virtue and efficacy of this death be not ſeated, revealed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the heart, a poore ſoule can take no comfort in it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is as certaine, he that enjoyes not Chriſt in him as a fruit of that one offering at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> enjoyes him not at all. The Scriptures often ſpeake of our being dead with Chriſt, that is to ſay, being implanted into the likeneſſe of his death, by being dead to ſinne and to iniquity: but no where ſpeake of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead in us, as the ſacrifice by which we are ſaved. If Chriſt be in us, the body is dead (not Chriſt) becauſe of ſin: and the ſpirit is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live becauſe of righteouſneſſe. Chriſts death hath a virtue in us, namely, deſtroying ſinne, and becoming a quickning ſpirit.</p>
               <p>4. Concerning the <hi>time</hi> of this ſacrifice being offered; <hi>In the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>God ſent forth his Son;</hi> it was in the laſt <note place="margin">The time when this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</note> dayes, ſo called in reſpect of diſpenſation, for now all under <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets vaniſhed, that Chriſt might come in and continue, <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> who

               <p>To ſee the truth clearly, Wee muſt conſider Chriſt Jeſus <hi>in his</hi>

                  <hi>death.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In the decree of God; and ſo he was fore-ordained before the <note place="margin">Chriſt ſlain by the decree of God.</note> 
                  <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> And all things were preſent before the Lord before they had being in reference to us, they were in the decree, councel and purpoſe of the Lord; ſo was the Lord Chriſt in Gods decree and councel before the World. <hi>He calleth things that are not, as though they were.</hi> What are only actually alone with us in time, were truely preſent with him before all time, who is not included in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the vertue of his death; and ſo he was <hi>ſlain before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The vertue of Chriſts death was before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World.</note> 
                  <hi>of the world:</hi> Chriſts death had an influence into the times paſt, as well as times to come; therefore called, <hi>The blood of the Covenant;</hi> Now we muſt know, that there was a Covenant made between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> wherein it was agreed that Chriſt ſhould die in time; and the vertue of that death, which was from eternity in the Eye of the Father, ſhould ſpeak for all his generation in all ages: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fathers of old believed, not in a Chriſt already then come, but to come, even in the fleſh: and therefore God led them by the hand to look to a Chriſt to come, through many Types and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; which when Chriſt came all ceaſed. Chriſts death was that price that was laid down for all his generation in all ages: and this is Chriſt, the ſame <hi>yeſterday and to day and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to conſider Chriſts actuall death, which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht <note place="margin">Chriſt actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died in time.</note> by the <hi>Jewes;</hi> therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, hath GOD Raiſed up;</hi> and thus was Chriſt manifeſt in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117308:25"/> the laſt times. Jeruſalem was not actually alwaies; <hi>Pilate</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; for we know that State, City, and thoſe perſons, had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining and ending: no more did Chriſt die actually before the World was; that he might dye, hee took upon him fleſh, and was made like to us, which is only done in time: for we firſt are in the Wombe, then brought forth, encreaſe and dye; ſo did he: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the vertue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, through the will of God, is as great as if hee had actually ſuffered before the World was; which he did not, but only once <hi>in the end of the World:</hi> And yet is <hi>Chriſt a prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck: Chriſt</hi> died once, and dyed no more; yet the benefit remaines for ever. So that as the Sacrifice is fully accepted by the Father, who views it ſince it was offered; ſo it was accepted by him that ſaw it before it was offered; for all things that God doth before us in time (which time the Scriptures tels abondantly, himſelfe hath made, ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; which time is that ſpace wherein things are done ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively) hee ſaw, liked, ordered and decreed ſhould be, before time was.</p>

               <head type="sub">Wherein is ſhewne how Chriſt offered up himſelf, and the true nature of that Offering.</head>
               <p>5 I am now to proceed, and ſhew you how <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">How Chriſt offered up himſelf.</note> unto GOD: which I ſhall demonſtrate theſe two waies,</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the power of the eternall Spirit; This Sacrifice was no <note place="margin">Chriſt offered up himſelf by the Spirit.</note> ordinary one, it was his <hi>owne body;</hi> therefore the power muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which was the Spirit of God that did ſuſtaine him, enable him to dye, and raiſed him from the dead; therefore ſaith Chriſt, I <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>lay down my life, and I have power to take it up againe;</hi> therefore is he ſaid to be <hi>juſtified in the Spirit, and quickned by the ſpirit:</hi> That Eternall Spirit that dwelt in him, ſuffered him not to lye in the grave; For it was impoſſible he ſhould bee held of death that was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fulneſſe of GOD, in whom the Eternall Spirit was.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt died <hi>in the body of his fleſh:</hi> It was impoſſible the <note place="margin">Chriſt died in</note>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117308:26"/> ſimple Word of God die, therefore the <hi>word was made fleſh; For as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">the body of his fleſh.</note> 
                  <hi>much as the Children were pertakers of fleſh and blood, Christ himſelfe tooke part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of death;</hi> ſo he in the fleſh <hi>aboliſhed the enmity:</hi> therefore it is ſaid, <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh</hi> in reference to his death; <hi>and juſtified in the Spirit</hi> in reference to his reſurrection: Therefore ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Chriſt <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 16.

                  <hi>ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjust; being put to death in the fleſh.</hi> A fleſhly body was prepared by God for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſuffer in; and ſo <hi>he gives them his fleſh, a ſacrifice for ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Thus, through the guidance of God, I am now come to ſpeak of the nature of this Sacrifice; which I have diſcovered to be the Lord Jeſus his fleſh, body and blood <hi>offered</hi> upon the <hi>Croſſe</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, in the end of the world, by the eternall Spirit</hi> for ſin. The excellency of its nature by a ſix fold demonſtration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From the purity of it: Under the Law their offerings <note place="margin">A pure Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Levit. 1. 3. 10. Mal. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> muſt be without blemiſh; therefore the Lord reproves the People, for that they brought that which was <hi>torne,</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> and the <hi>ſick;</hi> ſaying thus <hi>Ye brought an offering, ſhould I accept this of your hands ſaith the Lord?</hi> which is as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, I the Lord delight not in, but abhorre lame, blinde, imperfect offerings; I muſt have one <hi>without blemiſh.</hi> But now ſeeing all theſe <hi>unblemiſhable Lambs</hi> &amp;c. under the Law, could not take away ſin, either a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>without ſpot and blemiſh</hi> muſt be found, who is ſufficient to take <note place="margin">10. Joh. 1. 29. 36. Heb. 9. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> away ſin, or elſe ſin muſt remain; therefore the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſteps in. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the World,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldeſt not; Then ſaid I, Lo I come to doe thy Will O GOD.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the Lambe, of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the World: Who offered up</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 28. 11. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 22. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>himſelf to God without ſpot;</hi> for he is that true <hi>Lambe</hi> without blemiſh, and without ſpot. Herein our Jeſus was a <hi>Priest</hi> tranſcending the <hi>Prieſts</hi> under the Law, which had infirmity; and the Sacrifices under the Law that were imperfect: For the Lord Jeſus was pure and ſpot-leſſe; yea, perfectly pure: <hi>in whoſe mouth was found no guile: who knew no ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a great neceſſity he ſhould be ſuch an offering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, becauſe God was, and is, a God <hi>of pure Eyes, that cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity;</hi> that is to ſay, tolerate it, ſuffer it to go unpuniſhed: Now had <hi>Chriſt</hi> been a ſinner, he could not have taken away ſinne. This was the reaſon of the imperfection of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of old; which had they been perfect, we had had no need of another <hi>Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:117308:26"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is a free Sacrifice; Free-will offerings under the <note place="margin">Chriſts death a free ſacrifice</note> Law were very acceptable with God. Our <hi>Jeſus</hi> offered up his owne body freely; <hi>no man</hi> ſaith he <hi>takes my life from me; I lay it down. Lo I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>come to do thy will O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was, as pure and free, ſo a Perfect Sacrifice. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices <note place="margin">Chriſts death A perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> under the Law were without blemiſh, but not perfect; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus puts an end to them, and offers up himſelf. The offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Law were to be perfect without blemiſh as touching their bodies, they muſt not be blinde, broken, nor maimed or the like; but this was a perfection <hi>ſhaddowing out</hi> the true perfection of the Lord Jeſus; who wanted nothing, who had nothing ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but was a perfect Sacrifice; there needed no other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was an Eternall Sacrifice. It was offered in time, <note place="margin">Chriſts death an eternall Sacrifice.</note> but ordain'd before time; and the influences of it reached Eternity; a vertue ſprang from it to al his generation that fell aſleep before it was actually offered; and now being offered, it remaines in as full vertue as ever; <hi>for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> And ſo <hi>he was a Lambe ſlaine before the foundation of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>World; being the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever;</hi> even the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the ſame Saviour and deliverer; the ſame High-prieſt that ſaved <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaved <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſhall ſave all that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, It was a ſpiritual Sacrifice. In the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> the <note place="margin">Chriſts death a ſpirituall Sacrifice.</note> 
                  <hi>Prieſts</hi> went alwaies into the firſt <hi>Tabernacle, accompliſhing the ſervice of God; but into the ſecond, the</hi> High-prieſt <hi>only, once every year, not without blood, which he offered for his errors and the ſins of the people:</hi> Which <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> was a figure in that time; Now the Sacrifices and Gifts that were offered in that <hi>Tabernacle, ſtood only in meats, and drinks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers waſhings and carnall ordinances, impoſed on them until the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> but our <hi>High-prieſt enters into the holyeſt of holies,</hi> and there accompliſheth the ſervice of God: not with Meats, and Drinks, and carnall Ordinances, or Jewiſh obſervations; but <hi>with his blood,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirituall Sacrifice. Chriſt came with reformation, doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which was carnall; that is to ſay; of a fleſhly, legall (not ſinfull) adminiſtration, by his ſpirituall Sacrifice; Even the offering up of himſelfe, in body and ſpirit, <hi>The Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, let us view its nature with its accepataion: The <note place="margin">Chriſts death an acceptable Sacrifice.</note> Sacrifice was offered up to a juſt and righteous God, for an unjuſt and unrighteous people; and the Lord accepted it; ſo that the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:117308:27"/> is of the <hi>heavenly thing:</hi> Even the burnt offerings under the <hi>Law</hi> was a ſweet favour unto God, holding forth the excellency of the ſavour that our better Sacrifice, our ſubſtantiall offering, was to <hi>God:</hi> therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> He is that ſweet perfume that aſcends up to GOD; in whom the Father is only wel-pleaſed, <hi>who hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeen the travell of his Sonnes ſoul, and is ſatisfied:</hi> This is a moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſacrifice.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="chapter">
               <head>Chap. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">Manifesteth the true ſubjects for whom this Sacrifice was offered.</head>
               <p>7. HAving thus in mercy made manifeſt the nature of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and for as much as every ſacrifice that is offered is for ſome body, let us now enquire of the <hi>Perſons</hi> who are the ſubjects of this Sacrifice; which <hi>Chriſt</hi> declares to be his <hi>ſheep, I lay down my life for my Sheep.</hi> Thoſe Sheep are the Elect of God, whom the Lord <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 15.</note> hath appointed a place for, at his Right hand in the laſt day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Other Sheep have I which are not of this fold, them alſo I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt bring in, and they ſhall hear my voice.</hi> Again ſaith he, <hi>I know my Sheep.</hi> Chriſt makes it his work to Redeem a company of poor ſilly <hi>ſheep,</hi> from the <hi>wooles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſheep</hi> are thoſe who are given by God to Chriſt: <hi>Thine they were,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, that is to ſay, thine by thy choce, knowledge, decree and purpoſe: <hi>Thou gaveſt them me:</hi> that is, they being in the World a company of poor, deſpiſed, ſinfull creatures, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted'ſt <note place="margin">John 17. 6.</note> them to my charge, to reſcue them from the <hi>paw of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mouth of the Beare,</hi> and to keep them in thy name, that they may never depart from thee. Theſe are they <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed for, theſe only, and not for the World; that is to ſay, thoſe that were not given to him, to bring over by the power of his own Septer, to the obedience of the Goſpel, to the ſalvation of their ſouls: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall finde <hi>Chriſts</hi> prayer is not limited to the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his faithfull Apoſtles, but hee likewiſe prayes for all that ſhould believe in him: for their ſakes, he <hi>ſanctified himſelf;</hi> that is to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117308:27"/> ſay, he ſet himſelfe apart, and made it his worke to offer ſacrifice, and become a Redeemer: So much the word <hi>ſanctify</hi> clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. Theſe were a certaine number that Chriſt knew, and the Father loved, as he loved Chriſt; which in another place are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led children, as teſtifies the Spirit, ſaying, <hi>Foraſmuch as the children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, he likewiſe tooke part of the ſame, that he might deliver his children:</hi> Which children are thoſe that are his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> generation. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I, and the children which thou haſt given me:</hi> which children he cals his brethren, ſaying, <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy name unto my brethren.</hi> For this cauſe is the Lord Jeſus called, <hi>The Captaine of the ſalvation of many ſonnes:</hi> Becauſe he ſanctifieth-him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for them; for he is a perfect Captaine through ſufferings, to bring thoſe many ſonnes unto glory; which ſonnes are called, his family, his houſe, houſhold, ſpouſe, his city, his ſouldiers, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ones, which he governes, orders, diſpoſes, reſcues and traines up to eternall life; for Chriſt is faithfull as a ſonne over all his houſe.</p>
               <p>As they are his Children given to him, ſo we are to conſider them in a preſent condition of enmity to him; for he reconciles them: And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt died for the ungodly, for ſinners,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Scripture tels us, that Chriſt by the grace of God died for every man,</hi>

                  <hi>and that he is the Saviour of the whole world, and the propitiation for the ſins of the world; how is it then that you ſay, he offered up a ſacrifice onely for ſome choſen ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this Queſtion; I ſhall firſt ſhew you how the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> are miſtaken, then ſhew you how it cannot be that this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was offered for every individuall ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the objectors conceive.</p>
               <p>1. Concerning the Scriptures upon which this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is bottomed; I ſhall onely inſtance the principall: As firſt, that in the <hi>Hebrewes, Who by the grace of God taſted death for every</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>man.</hi> From whence they inferre every particular perſon in the world to finde the truth of this Scripture. Let us ſee the truth of it by comparing it with what followes; this <hi>every man,</hi> in the next verſe is declared to be <hi>many ſons,</hi> yea, <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>children.</hi> The
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117308:28"/> word in the Originall is, <hi>for all;</hi> which we muſt take with ſome limitation: It is ſaid, <hi>All Judea came out to be baptized of John in Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan:</hi> Now I ſuppoſe no one will imagine he meaneth <hi>every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon,</hi> every <hi>infant,</hi> but a great number: ſo here by all we may underſtand a great number.</p>
               <p>Or if you reade the word, <hi>every one,</hi> we likewiſe reade, that Jeſus Chriſt commanded the Apoſtles to preach the Goſpell to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Creature:</hi> By every Creature I ſuppoſe we take not in the beaſts of the earth, fiſhes of the ſea, and fowles of heaven; if without all limitation we take the word, we cannot except them, except we deny them to be creatures, which I hope we are all better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that Chriſts dying for every man muſt be reſtrained to thoſe onely Chriſt intended it, namely, thoſe many ſons whom God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto Glory.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture is that in <hi>John,</hi> which ſaith, He is the <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the whole world.</hi> From whence many inferre, that Chriſt is a propitiation for the <note place="margin">1 John 2. 2.</note> ſins of every individuall perſon in the world: ſtrengthening their opinion from thoſe Scriptures that affirme <hi>Chriſt is the Saviour of the world: And God ſo loved the world,</hi> and <hi>would have all men to be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to theſe, we muſt neceſſarily be able to diſtinguiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this word <hi>world:</hi> For I affirme it is not alwaies taken for every particular one; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent called the Devill and Satan, which deceiveth the world.</hi> Which <hi>world</hi> is onely meant of the <hi>wicked,</hi> or of <hi>many</hi> in the world. Therefore it is ſaid in the Verſes before, that <hi>there was warre in heaven, Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon and his, and there was a remnant in the world, a woman in the wilderneſſe that was not deceived.</hi> So that by the <hi>whole world</hi> is onely meant thoſe that were deceived in the world. So it is ſaid, <hi>all the whole world</hi> wondred after the beaſt; which is not meant of <hi>every</hi> particular perſon, therfore is it interpreted afterward, to be <hi>all thoſe that dwell on the earth, whoſe names are not written in the Lambs booke of Life.</hi> In another place it is ſaid, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes.</hi> Now we know the Lord doth impute ſinne to ſome, therefore is it not of every one that he ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid, <hi>God is the Saviour of the world;</hi> and yet in another place, the <hi>world</hi> ſhall be damned: So that it is very evident where he ſaith, he is the propitiation for ours, and the whole world; he meanes them that did believe, and hereafter ſhould believe, <hi>all</hi> them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117308:28"/> he writes to, and <hi>all</hi> in all ages that ſhall be ſaved; and ſo the reſt of the Scriptures muſt be underſtood. The world is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for every individuall, ſometimes for many, for ſome of all ſorts for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> before it was ſaid, ſalvation is of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> But now of the whole world, that is to ſay, of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>God ſo loved the world that whoſoever believed ſhould not periſh: He ſo loved it,</hi> that is to ſay, after ſuch a manner as thoſe, that is, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall believe ſhould not periſh.</hi> So that his love is clearely reſtrained to them that ſhould believe. Therefore the Scriptures ſo often ſpeake, that God hath choſen a people out of world, the <hi>poore</hi> of the <hi>world;</hi> he hath redeemed us out of every nation, kindred and tongue, ſome of all nations; So that as there are two worlds ſpoken of, <hi>this</hi> world, and <hi>that</hi> world, namely, the world to come, ſo there are ſubjects of both worlds, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are called the world; and they are either the world of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that cannot receive the truth, or the world that ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and is reconciled unto God.</p>

                  </label> all, and yet Chriſts death is but a ſacrifice for ſome; the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell is univerſall, the application particular. The Sunne ſhines on good and bad; ſome things it quickens, others it withers: Now the <hi>act</hi> of ſhining is a like to him that is blinde, and him that ſees, but the <hi>virtue</hi> of it is onely to ſome particulars: A man that is blind hath not the benefit of the light; this appears more plain, if we conſider what the Goſpell is that is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <note place="margin">What the Goſpell is that is to be preached to the World.</note> It is that there is life and ſalvation freely in Chriſt for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is to be told, preached and declared to all men, yea, every man: but now the application of it is onely to him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth this, and truſteth in it; which is the worke of the Spirit to accompliſh. We are not to preach Chriſt died for you <hi>Thomas,</hi> or you <hi>John,</hi> but for ſinners. And thus the Apoſtles preached; and if any one asked what they ſhould doe to be ſaved, their anſwer was, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved, whether thou beeſt Jew or Gentile,</hi> Acts 16. 31.</p>

               <p>For when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned by tranſgreſſing the Law, that curſed and ſeized on him and all his poſterity in him; but yet Chriſt was immediately promiſed: So that notwithſtanding his ſin, all that looked to, or believed on that <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> ſhould be healed, thoſe that did not ſhould periſh in their ſins; this ſtate of unbeliefe ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the Creature; Which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The cauſe why he truſts not in Chriſt, nor comes to him; which is to be underſtood in this ſenſe, in that it hath taken ſuch hold on man, that he cannot come forth of it; for if he could but believe he ſhould certainly be ſaved, but he cannot, therefore he is condemned: though this is not the originall or firſt cauſe of his deſtruction: for his ſinne that he fell into, was that; that put him into an incapacity of believing according to the purpoſe of God; which indeed is the originall cauſe why they cannot believe: for if God had purpoſed they ſhould believe, neither themſelves, nor men, nor ſin, nor devils, could have hindred it; for who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the will of God? <hi>For as many as were ordained to eternall life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: You believe not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe you are are not my ſheepe:</hi> That <note place="margin">Rom. 9.

Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He that believes not is condemned already,</hi> becauſe he hath not beleived: or as the word will beare it, in that he hath not believed; which is thus explained a little after, <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117308:29"/> that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſſe;</hi> it is the condemnation it ſelf.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this I thus briefly Anſwer, Man is truely ſaid to refuſe the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> Goſpel, when he rejects it, deſpiſes it and perſecutes it, and then declares he himſelf unworthy of it: All men are unworthy of it, but the Jewes in the <hi>Acts</hi> eminently declared them ſelves to be ſo; Here we may take notice how the Goſpel is to be preached to All, not for All; for when he knew who was unworthy, he turnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, but he was ſent to preach to all, not knowing who was made worthy to recieve it by the Lambe: that Gods own might be called in, he preached it to, or among, or in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all; and this was lawfull for him ſo to doe; but he <hi>applied it</hi> to none but upon believing.</p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome are yet ready to ſay, <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> How ſhall we eſcape if wee neglect ſo great ſalvation? <hi>Which they could not do, if it was not for them,</hi> Heb. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay thus much, All that can be inferred rationally or <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> ſpiritually from thoſe words is this, That deſtruction is the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them that neglect (that is to ſay) minde not, or receive not ſalvation: which excellently holds forth this truth, that there is no other way of ſalvation but by giving heed to, or imbracing the Goſpel, which he exhorts them to a ſted faſtnes in.</p>
               <p>But may ſome ſay, <hi>If Chriſt died for them, they ſhall be ſaved</hi> (as you <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, That although the Saints Eternal happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <label type="milestone">

                  </label> depends on the Fathers purpoſe for their ſalvation, yet the true ground of viſible adminiſtrations, is from the viſible profeſſion of the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; for with the heart man believeth,</hi> but <hi>with</hi>

                  <hi>the mouth he confeſſeth to ſalvation:</hi> the Apoſtle judging according to <note place="margin">It is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to fall from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> their profeſſion, thus ſpeaks. For though a man cannot fall from the Fathers love, yet he may from his profeſſion; which when he doth, 'tis (though not an infalilble) yet a ſad ſimptome he is in a ſad condition; <hi>nigh to burning;</hi> having neither part, nor lot, in the thing profeſſed, as ſaith the Apoſtle. Now becauſe <hi>ſome</hi> did profeſs to be bought by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have received the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to be <hi>ſactified</hi>

               <p>That Chriſt wept over it, and would have gathered it, is true but yet, that he did not lay down his life a Sacrifice for them that hee did not gather, is as true: Chriſts weeping over them ſhews him to be a man ſubject to like paſſions with us (ſin only excepted) he laments their deplorable, miſerable, undone and loſt ſtate: And whereas he ſaith <hi>How often would I have gathered</hi> them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He there ſpeaks as a viſible miniſter of the Goſpel, that holds forth the truth to men, not knowing their eternal ſtate; for if you conſider him otherwaies, he could not weepe over them, for it is ſaid, <hi>he knew all men,</hi> and would not commit himſelfe to a people that did profeſſe him: he knew (as he was the wiſdome of the Father) well enough who ſhould not believe, but dye in their ſinnes; therfore this he did as a man having naturall affections: and ſo it is ſaid, when Jeſus heard <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, <hi>he wept;</hi> which ſhewed, not that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might have lived longer, but his love, his natural love to him.

Hath hee not made thee? from not being, he hath given thee being: Art thou thine owne or his? <hi>Nay, but O Man, Who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> Shall the Veſſell ſay to the Potter, Why haſt thou made me thus? <hi>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lumpe, to make one veſſel unto honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> And hath not GOD the ſame power over thee, as the potter hath over his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel?

                  <hi>Man was made upright, but he ſought out many inventions.</hi> God made man, planted him in a Garden in the middeſt of all worldly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117308:31"/> pleaſures, for bad him nothing but one Tree in the middle of the Garden, told him if he did eat thereof he ſhould dye; this Law was given to him, the Devil taking advantage of the Creatures muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (for God did not, neither was he bound to make the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture immutable) ſpake to the woman by a Serpent, even a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beaſt of the earth, that eats duſt, and creeps on her belly; <hi>Eve</hi> would be wiſe, beleeved the Devil, ate of the Tree, brake the Law, and ſo came to know good and evil; ſhee knew not good and evil before, but now, ſhe felt the evil, and died; that is, the evil of fear, and ſhame (the fruit of ſin) ſeized upon them. This Tree was a Tree of triall to them of their obedience: now <hi>ſin came, and death by ſinne; Adam</hi> was turned out of the Garden; ſorrow encompaſſed them; the Tree of life, a viſible Tree pointing out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> denied them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would <hi>ſhew the riches of his grace,</hi> and <hi>the glory of his juſtice:</hi> had <hi>Adam</hi> eaten of that <hi>Tree of life,</hi> he and all his poſterity had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ever; but God would not ſuffer it, but would advance juſtice in the condemnation of ſome; and ſo keeps him out <hi>with a ſtaming Sword;</hi> that is to ſay, his Law or mighty power. Thus do we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the thing forbidden to us; we are not contented with our ſphere; ſurely this conſideration renders God juſt in our ruine, and 'tis only mercy that ſaves any of us.</p>
               <p>Thus man was plunged in this darknes, yet Chriſt came as a <hi>light ſhining in darknes, but the darknes,</hi> the dark ſinfull heart of man, <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not,</hi> but oppoſed it: Chriſt ſaith he is the true <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>Meſſia,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of God, that life eternal is in him, the <hi>Jewes</hi> neglected, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſcorned and abuſed him; ſo do many now; by which they adde iniquity to iniquity, and are juſtly Condemned for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But that I may the more clearly demonſtrate the falſity of this <hi>aſſertion,</hi> conſider theſe following <hi>Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that Chriſt died for, hee offered a Sacrifice for; for his death was a Sacrifice for ſinne, as I have at large proved before. <note place="margin">Arg. to prove Chriſt died nor for all men.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſt offered not a ſacrifice for all men, therefore he died not for all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſecond propoſition is clearly proved,</hi> if you conſider this,</p>
               <p>That all thoſe for whom this Sacrifice was offered, are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perfected by it, having through it Remiſſion of ſinnes; which is evident, <hi>for by one Offering hath he perfected for ever, them that are ſanctified:</hi> and again, <hi>We are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Chriſt, once for all:</hi> he bore the ſinnes of many, and by that Sacrifice he carried them away, that God remembers them in a way of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no more. This will be more manifeſted if you conſider what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117308:32"/> I ſhall ſay in the vertue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death.</p>
               <p>But there are a people that ſhall never be made perfect, nor have ſinnes done away: this is ſo evident by it ſelf, that it needs no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration: conſult with the 25. <hi>Mat.</hi> and you may there (if you doubt) ſinde a reſolution.</p>
               <p>Having thus handled the Subjects for whom this Sacrifice was <note place="margin">To whom this ſacrifice was offered.</note> offered, I am now come to ſhew you, to whom it was offered; namely, to <hi>GOD,</hi> to an offended, diſpleaſed and angry Majeſty, That could not endure Sinne, and which threatened death to Sinners.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>full of the fury of the Lord.</hi> So that we muſt know, fury, wrath, anger, is in God by a Law, which is the righteous diſpenſatinn of juſtice and judgement, by his owne Law, againſt the breakers of it: And yet fury is not in God, that is, God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſo taken <hi>away the Cup of trembling, and the dregs of his fury,</hi> that fury is not in him to his Children; for GOD in Chriſt is love, full of love: GOD in the Law is a recompencer of <hi>tribulation, and anguiſh, to all that obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>THis Sacrifice is better then all other ſacrifices, tranſcends all under the Law, comprehends all manner of excellency in it ſelf: and the vertue whereof appeares,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> by this one Sacrifice, interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">Chriſt inter-1 poſed between God and man.</note> God and <hi>poor, ſilly, ſorry</hi> man; between Gods wrath, venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and fury, and ſinfull rebellious man: Gods hand of juſtice was up, mans neck upon the block, ready for his fatall, and finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: Even as <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand was up ready to ſlay his Sonne; But as then the <hi>Angel</hi> ſtept in and laid his hand on <hi>Abrahams Sword,</hi> ſo the <hi>Angel</hi> of our new <hi>Govenant,</hi> immediately interpoſed himſelf
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117308:32"/> and became that <hi>Ram</hi> in the <hi>buſh</hi> that was ready to dye in our ſtead, and be offered for us that we might be ſpared; ſo Chriſt held Gods hand, and ſtaved off his wrath, (as I may ſo ſay) and now ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not onely to reſpite mans miſery for a ſhort time; But</p>
               <p>Secondly, He mediates betweene God and man for a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <note place="margin">Chriſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates between God and man.</note> man was the offender, ſentence was given againſt him to condemnation; nothing was wanting to compleate his miſery, but a full execution, and eternity to locke him up faſt in wrath and torment. Now the Lord Jeſus interpoſes himſelfe to make up the breach; and therefore is he called, <hi>The Mediator betweene God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the New Covenant; He it is, not <hi>duties,</hi> not <hi>prayers,</hi> not <hi>faſts,</hi> not the <hi>performances</hi> of the Creature, that makes reconciliation and attonement for the ſins of the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By this ſacrifice he hath given full ſatisfaction to God <note place="margin">Chriſt hath given ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God the Father.</note> the Father, for whatever he could lay to our charge. Man, as I ſaid before, was condemned to dye, wrath was threatned, he became a debtor to the Law: Now the Lord Chriſt undertakes the payment of his debt, he would anſwer the Law, and pay whatever the Law could demand, even to <hi>the utmoſt farthing;</hi> he became the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe ſake; he died and became a curſe, (for it is written, <hi>Curſed be every one that hangeth on a tree)</hi> that we might be bleſſed and live for ever.</p>
               <p>Yea further, The Lord Jeſus that he might be a perfect Saviour, bore our ſinnes in his owne body on the Croſſe, and the Father laid on him, <hi>The iniquities of us all, and he was numbred among, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the tranſgreſſors:</hi> Which holds forth to me the Father <note place="margin">Iſaiah 53. 12.</note> ſpeaking (if I may ſo ſay) after this manner to his Son: <hi>Son, wilt thou undertake for this man, this ſinfull man; his ſinnes are as ſearlet, his offence is great, the puniſhment is as great: thou muſt take all his ſinnes and faults upon thy ſelfe, and ſtand in his ſtead, and ſuffer whatever I have threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon him, thou muſt be made ſin for him,</hi> that is to ſay, an offering for his ſinne, and a ſufferer as a ſinner. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Father thy will be done, I will rather beare his ſinnes in my owne body; I will rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the extremity of thy wrath, then thoſe whom I love ſhall dye;</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Father accepted him; the Covenant and contract was made, and now Chriſt who is our <hi>ſcape goat,</hi> carries all our ſinnes in his owne body into the land of forgetfulneſſe, that God ſaith, <hi>I will remember their ſinnes no more:</hi> that is to ſay, as unſatisfied for, or in judgement againſt them; and I now can ſee no ſinne in my

Who ſhall condemn me? It is Chriſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me, though I am unrighteous; juſtice is ſatisfied that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be condemned, for Chriſt hath taken away the curſe, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Lawes mouth; for he is the true <hi>ſinne-offering</hi> and <hi>treſpaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering</hi> typified in the Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hath opened the way for the ſoule to come to God, from whom before (trembling) he ran away and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, covering his nakedneſſe with figge leaves, not daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the preſence of the Lord. The ſoule, till Chriſt died, ſtood aloofe off, had no ſight of God but in ſhadowes, types and figures; but now the Lord Jeſus by his death made way for the ſoule to come to God, the <hi>Vaile</hi> of the Temple is rent in twaine: which is interpreted in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be the <hi>opening of the way into the most holy place;</hi> into which under the Law none but the High Prieſt might enter, and that but <hi>under a ſhadow</hi> once a yeare; but Chriſt by his owne bloud hath opened the way that we may with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have acceſſe to God: Chriſt, the Lords Anointed, hath ſo ordered the matter, being partaker of both natures, that God and man ſhould meet in him: in him God appeares in love, mercy and grace: in him the Saints meet the Lord, in righteouſneſſe, ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and praiſe; ſo that he that hid himſelfe before, hath now no durable joy nor true content, but when in the ſight of God in the Lord Jeſus. Oh what a matchleſſe mercy is here two at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and enmity ſhould be reconciled and meet in one, joying, rejoycing, praiſing and delighting each in other. Oh here I am forced to ſtay a while in admiration of that boundleſſe love, and unfathomable wiſedome of our deare Jeſus; our well-beloved Bridegroome, that ſtript himſelfe of his robes, and clothed himſelf with our ſinnes, that knew no ſinne, for to bring us into an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate familiarity and acquaintance with our Maker. <hi>Oh my ſoule, for this bleſſe the Lord, yea, let all that is within mee praiſe his holy name; yea, let all that love the ſalvation of the Lord ſay, Let the Lord be magnified.</hi>

That we may come to a more cleare underſtanding of this, I deſire you would minde, that to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify ſignifies either to make one juſt who before was unjuſt, or to declare one to be juſt. And againe, a man is ſaid to be made juſt, when of a ſinner he is waſhed and cleanſed, as of a drunkard he is become ſober, and the like; or when he is acquitted of his fault: So that though many ſins remaine, they ſhall not condemne him. In this laſt ſenſe is a man ſaid, according to the Scriptures, to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or have his ſinnes pardoned, or be acquitted. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not his ſin,</hi> that is, <hi>whoſe ſin is forgiven, bid or</hi>

               <p>So likewiſe the declaration of a man to be a juſt man, or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is two-fold; either to his owne ſoule, or to others: Now according to the Scriptures, it is the acquitall from ſinnes, that is, properly called juſtification. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation came upon all, ſo juſtification upon many:</hi> juſtification is there taken for the contrary to condemnation, which is the freedome from it: Therefore ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Wee are juſtified by his bloud, and by the Spirit.</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>more conſcience of ſinne;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>guilt for ſinne;</hi> which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more plainely by this ſimilitude: A man hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an offence againſt the Law, ſuppoſe felony or treaſon; Now the Law ſaith, <hi>He that ſo offendeth ſhall dye the death:</hi> The conſcience of his fault preſently ſtrikes horrour to his Spirit; the man is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and impriſoned for it, and ſhut up till the diſmall day of execution: Now while the poore man can expect nothing but death, ſome freind of his, unknowne to him, ſues for his pardon, ſatisfies the Law, and obtaines it, by which, his freind hath made ſure of his life; Now is the man truly juſtified or acquitted from his fault though he knowes it not; Well, what then? His freind coures to him and ſaith, Be of good cheere, thy offence is forgiven thee, and ſo gives him his pardon, which he gladly accepts; and having received it, he is now delivered from his bondage, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon opened, and the Goalor commanded to ſet him at liberty, and he is as ſurely freed from the offence as if he had not ſinn'd at all. Even ſo it is with a poore ſoule; for when man ſinned, wrath, even eternall miſery was threatned, and his ſpirit filled with horrour. Now the Lord Chriſt, when the ſoule was a ſtranger to him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his pardon, purchaſed it with his owne bloud, and then the mans eternall happineſſe was made ſure of; and when the Lord Chriſt tels him what he hath done for him, ſaying to him, <hi>Thy ſins are pardoned, my Son, feare not:</hi> then wrath, horrour, guilt and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour fly away, and the man is by faith, that is to ſay, by believing what Chriſt hath done, at peace in his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Faith, I ſay, is not the mans juſtification, or righteouſneſſe, but receives it, for it is a free gift of God.</p>

We are to conſider, that before we were actually, Chriſt Jeſus died, and when he died he bore our ſinnes in his owne body, the puniſhment that we deſerved, Chriſt ſuffered, he is and was our truſty Advocate that pleaded our cauſe and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Law, againſt which the ſinne was; ſo that condemnation is by a Law; take away the Law the condemnation ceaſes. Now Jeſus triumphed over our ſinnes and the Law (as I ſhall ſhew more fully anon) on the Croſſe, and made a ſhew of them openly: So that they could never be able to returne upon us to condemne us; and under this conſideration I affirme all ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, were then pardoned by the bloud of the Croſſe: For as Chriſt at once died for all ſinnes, paſt, preſent, and to come, ſo were they pardoned. Which pardon was given to Chriſt, for him to communicate to us; Which leades us to the ſecond conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, our guilt, feare, horrour and terrour, and Chriſts love to us then; for he having obtained our pardon, as he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it he gives it to the ſoule a full, compleate, perfect pardon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this friendly manner, <hi>Thou that hideſt thy ſelfe in the ſtaires,</hi> and <hi>in the clifts of the rocke,</hi> in a deſolate and forlorne condition, that <hi>watereſt thy bed with teares,</hi> and expecteſt nothing but wrath, <hi>feare not, though thy ſinnes be as ſcarlet I have made them as white as ſnow:</hi> And ſo commands Satan their Goalor to flye, the Iron gates of their owne guilt to open, and takes him by the hand and leades him into the Paradiſe of God by faith, into his Fathers Kingdome: which act of Chriſt upon mans ſpirit is mans Juſtification; according to that in the <hi>Acts, We preach remiſſion of ſinnes by Jeſus Chriſt, for every one that believeth is juſtified from all things:</hi> (marke the word,) <hi>from all things, from which he could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>You hath he quickened, who were dead in ſinnes, having forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you all treſpaſſes.</hi> Minde it, the worke is done, the Law cannot charge him; ſo that if a Saint ſinnes now (as in truth wee doe, <hi>For be that ſaith he hath no ſinne, is a lyar, and deceiveth himſelfe)</hi> he may looke to his Advocate, pleading ſatisfaction already given; trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly ſinging, <hi>There is now no condemnation or damnation to him that is in Chriſt with a ſure confidence;</hi> None can now legally (thoug ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may unjuſtly) lay any thing to his charge, for God juſtifies him; he that was offended is ſatisfied. Neither can any condemne him, for tis Chriſt that died for him: now in this ſenſe likewiſe it is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117308:35"/> very ſure all ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, are pardoned; for this ſecond is onely the declaration of the firſt.</p>

                  <hi>Servants of God in the Old Testament, as</hi> David, Daniel, <hi>&amp;c. prayed for pardon of ſinne, and that Christ commanded his Diſciples to pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

                  <hi>of their ſinnes, and that we are required to confeſſe our ſinnes one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pray one for another; and God himſelfe ſaith, If we doe confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull to forgive them; therefore, they are not all pardoned at once, if they were, what need we pray for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the examples or precepts concerning praying for pardon <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> of ſinne, I anſwer, That it was a ſutable act to that ſtate and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that conſiſted in a legall diſpenſation; they ſaw not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things we ſee; they were continually to offer ſacrifice for ſinne, and ſurely thoſe that might offer ſacrifice for ſinne, might pray for the pardon thereof; So that their praying for pardon of ſinne no more proves it our duty, then their offering ſacrifices makes it a duty to us ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>As to that precept of Chriſt to his Diſciples, we are to minde, that Chriſt intended not alwaies to confine his Diſciples to that manner of praying, but that forme was agreeable to that diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Kingdome of Heaven was not then come, <hi>It was but at hand;</hi> but now it is come, and we may boldly goe to God.</p>
               <p>As concerning the other Scriptures that ſay, <hi>Confeſſe your ſinnes one to another,</hi> and <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes he is faithfull to forgive us:</hi> If you conſider what I have ſaid before, it might be ſufficient. Theſe expreſſions onely ſpeake of a forgiveneſſe and acquittall in a mans Conſcience: So though a ſoule may be in ſome doubt, theſe are an encouragement for him not to hide his face, and runne away in feare, but boldly to acknowledge them upon the head of the <hi>Scape Goate</hi> the Lord Jeſus; and <hi>God is juſt and faithfull to forgive them,</hi> that is to ſay, to manifeſt the forgiveneſſe of them to thee; for ſinne is either chargeable before God, or in the Conſcience; before God it is not; therefore in Conſcience onely; and as it is chargeable, ſuch is the forgiveneſſe; it many times fares with a Saint, as with a man arreſted with a Bond formerly cancelled; the man hereupon is filled with feare, beginning to call in queſtion whether his ſurety hath cancelled it or no, and ſo calls upon his ſurety for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Bond, that he may be aſſured he is freed from it by the Law, though unjuſtly vexed for it: Even ſo, I ſay, fares it many times with a Saint; Jeſus Chriſt hath told him, the Law is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117308:35"/> his debt paid, the bond cancelled; the Devil aſſalts him, ſets his ſins, his debts in order before his eyes, and charges the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; whereby the ſoul begins <hi>to fear againe,</hi> and is ready to qeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath told him ſo as he did before believe; and now he cries out for his pardon, that the bond may be taken out of his way, that he may be ſet at liberty through the manifeſtation of Chriſts love: yea, I ſay farther, A man that hath obtained a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from his Prience, may be attached for the ſame offence, and now may deſire, in confidence that his ſurety, in whoſe hands the pardon is, to give it him, that ſo he may be ſet at liberty: let me tell you, Satan many times aſſaults the ſoule and troubles it, and then many a ſoul in faith asks his pardon, or the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his pardon, that ſo he may be freed from Satans buffetings: and thus in the Scripture it is frequent to aske the thing produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a benifit for the effects ſake; as for inſtance, we may deſire to eate the fleſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when wee meane the benefit that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to us from it; ſo that the ſum and ſubſtance of what I have ſaid is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſin is fully ſatisfied for by Chriſts death in the ſight of God, and ſhal never be charged upon a Saint which pardon is in the hands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſinne lieth in the conſcience til believing, and when the ſoul believes, is forgiveneſſe given to him: that is to ſay, publiſhed, made manifeſt and declared.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That though he may be freed, yet be in trouble or fear againe (for according to the meaſure of his faith, ſuch is his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and conſolation) &amp; then he may pray for the pardon of ſin: that is to ſay, the fuller aſſurance of it; and may ask for pardon of ſinne, as it includes his right to be freed from trouble or wrath for them any more. So that I ſay, all ſinnes are pardoned in the ſenſe I have already declared, paſt, preſent and to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay that a Saint after believing</hi> may fear againe, <hi>which if it be true,</hi>

                  </label> to tel them that it is impoſſible for them to fear againe; but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is there, to hold forth the excellency of the Spirit; it was not the ſpirit of bondage, engendering to fear, that they had received through the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but the Spirit of adoption, whereby they could cry <hi>Abba Father;</hi> and therefore the ſame Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117308:36"/> of the <hi>Galathians</hi> whether <hi>they received the Spirit by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, or by the hearing of faith;</hi> commanding them <hi>to hold faſt their liberty,</hi> and not to be <hi>intangled with the yoake of bondage,</hi> which is the ſpirit of feare in the Law, which the <hi>Galathians</hi> were ſubject to, not through the preaching of Chriſt, but through the ſubtilty of deceivers preaching the Law: And the truth is, ſo farre as wee be ſubject to be in bondage to feare, ſo farre wee runne to the Law; there is no ſuch thing produced by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter, I ſhall lay down three prevailing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; or Scripture reaſons, to prove that all ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come, in the ſenſe before explained, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
               <p>1. If all a believers ſinnes be not pardoned at once, he may bee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> truely in the ſtate of wrath and condemnation after believing.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, believers are not at all truely in the ſtate of wrath or condemnation;</p>
               <p>Therefore all their ſinnes are pardoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition is manifeſt, if you do but conſider what it is not to have ſin pardoned, it is to be in the ſtate of wrath or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; for he is bleſſed whoſe ſinnes are <hi>Covered,</hi> or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
               <p>The word of the Apoſtle proves the ſecond, ſaying, <hi>There is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all ſinnes be not pardoned at once, then ſome are not <hi>Covered:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> Which is evident if we conſider that the covering of ſin is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſin, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are covered:</hi> If ſin be alwaies covered, it is buried; and ſo incapable of riſing up againſt us: and ſo, if not pardoned, tis not covered.</p>
               <p>But all their ſinnes are alwaies Covered; Which appeares in that when Chriſt died, he carried them away in his own body, in to a <hi>Land of Oblivion,</hi> that God ſaith, <hi>I will remember their ſins no more:</hi> Chriſt is our <hi>propitiation,</hi> all our ſinnes <hi>are blotted out,</hi> raſed, covered, buried, nailed to the Croſſe that they cannot hurt us.</p>
               <p>If all the ſins of a believer be not pardoned at once by the <hi>Lord,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> then may ſome be laid to his charge; Which is evident of it ſelfe, for the pardon is the acquittance, or diſcharge from ſin.</p>
               <p>But none can be laid to their charge: therefore ſaith Paul, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> Nothing can charge a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever except it bee the Law: I meane, nothing can juſtly charge him. Now the Law cannot doe it, as I will ſhew you in the next Chapter.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:117308:36"/>
               <p>Therefore I conclude, All ſinnes are pardoned at once, in the ſenſe before named.</p>

               <head type="sub">Sheweth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue of Christs death, freeing us from the Law.</head>
               <p>FOr the fuller clearing of this, I ſhall endeavour to make it appeare,</p>
               <p>Firſt, from what Law we are freed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In what manner, or under what conſideration we are freed.</p>
               <p>1. The Law we are freed from, is the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Law given on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> It is needfull for us to know thoſe two diſpenſations, the one by God to <hi>Adam</hi> and all the World; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Law; which we may perceive in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where it is written, <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law; viz.</hi> as it was given to Iſrael by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that diſpenſation or miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>do by nature,</hi> that is to ſay, by that original inſtinct or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is in all their hearts by creation; <hi>the things contained in the Law, viz.</hi> of Moſes; <hi>theſe having not the Law, viz.</hi> given them by <hi>Moſes are a Law unto themſelves,</hi> that is to ſay, they have it in their hearts; <hi>Which ſhew the worke of the Law written in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appeares yet more evident if we conſider, the puniſhment threatned by both was the ſame; therefore is it ſaid <hi>verſe 15. Their conſcience bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing one another;</hi> their owne hearts accuſing them is a manifeſt proofe of wrath to be the fruit of ſin, and condemnation the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>By one man ſin entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and death by ſin,</hi> this death is explained to be <hi>judgement to condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Law and puniſhment be the ſame, that of Adam and that of Moſes, to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, No verily; though the ſubſtance was the ſame, yet the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> adminiſtration was divers: <hi>The Law of Moſes was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> the Law entred, <hi>that the offence might abound,</hi> that the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117308:37"/> ſinfulneſſe of ſin might be diſovered, that ſo it might diſcover the dead ſinfull eſtate they were in, that thought themſelves alive: <hi>For by the Law, is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> The offence was before, but <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded</hi> not; Man I ſay, was even dead in ſin, ſtupid and careleſſe, till the Law was given on Sinai: Then thundered out curſes, that is to ſay; now God was reſolved to make appear the wickedneſſe of ſin: but this was only to Iſrael, a choſen people, other Nations had not this priviledge: for this Law we muſt underſtand was not given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to them; for <hi>the ſervice of God and the promiſes</hi> were annexed to it; they had many types to hold forth their Saviour the Lord Jeſus to doe that for them that might anſwer for what they themſelves could not doe; and by this were the Gentiles (for ſo the Jews cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the reſt of the Nations) hedged forth; this was a partition wall: Now Paul was once <hi>alive without the Law, viz.</hi> in his own conceipt, <hi>but when the Command came, ſin revived;</hi> for <hi>the Law was given that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence might abound; and Paul died, viz.</hi> ſaw his dead condition; ſo that <hi>the Commandement which was appointed to life,</hi> that is to ſay, to drive men to Jeſus; <hi>for the Law was a School-master to Chriſt;</hi> even the Law of Commands, whippings and laſhings, as wel as the Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſhadowing forth Chriſt to us, <hi>Who is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe. Hee found was to death to him,</hi> that is to ſay, through the deceitfulnes of ſin ſlew him, as being the executioner againſt him: ſo that this Law was but the fuller diſcovery of the other <hi>Law:</hi> for the curſe was all one.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> is to be conſidered ſeveral waies, I ſhall ſhew <note place="margin">Vnder what conſideration we are freed from the law.</note> you in what ſenſes we may look upon the <hi>Law,</hi> and in which ſenſe we are freed from it. Now we may look upon the <hi>Law</hi> foure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies,</p>
               <p>Firſt, As a covenant of works, <hi>Doe this and live,</hi> do it not, and <hi>thou ſhalt dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As given by <hi>Moſes</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As <hi>written in the heart</hi> in the firſt Creation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As written in our hearts in the ſecond Creation by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two firſt waies are as two legal coppies, the one appearing more plainly to be read then the other; this Covenant of Works to <hi>Adam, If thou doeſt this, thou ſhalt dye,</hi> was written in great Letters (as I may ſo ſay) to Iſrael.</p>
               <p>the wrighting of the Law, <hi>of loving God, and our Neighbour,</hi> in the heart, in the firſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> creation, is faire written by Jeſus, by the <hi>finger of</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:117308:37"/> Gods ſpirit in our heart in the new Creation, <hi>Jeremiah 31. I will write my Law in your heart, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you conſider the Law, as given by <hi>Moſes</hi> written in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone, it was to the Jews the miniſtration of death, or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes, to which appertained ceremonies and ſacrifices: In which ſenſe we Gentiles neither have, nor ever had any thing to doe with it; it was onely ſo given to the Jewes: Therefore it is ſaid, We are not come to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that might not be touched; but to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the grace of God in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Now if you conſider the Law as a Covenant of workes to <hi>Adam,</hi> though we were under it we are freed from it; for what curſes the <hi>Jewes</hi> were ſubject to by the Law, as written in Tables of Stone: we were, as the Law at firſt was written in our hearts, likewiſe ſubject to: For <hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſonnes, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-woman; the one from <hi>Sinai</hi> engendring to bondage, the other from Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> one of workes, the other of grace: We are now freed from the curſe of the Law, and there is no <hi>Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As by the firſt <hi>Adam ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne,</hi> ſo by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>The free gift came of many</hi> (yee all) <hi>offences,</hi> of them he died for to juſtification of life; it is not now ſaid to us to doe this and live, but becauſe you live, therefore doe this; 'tis not now ſaid, <hi>If thou eatest</hi> (I meane to the Fathers choſen ones) <hi>thou ſhalt dye:</hi> but being dead thou ſhalt live by Jeſus Chriſt; if thou ſinneſt thou haſt an <hi>Advocate</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who covers all thy ſinnes, ſo that the Goſpell brings good newes: and hence is it that we heare ſo much of <hi>life eternall,</hi> and <hi>freedome from the curſe;</hi> which makes mee deſire thee to looke a little backe to the variety of Gods diſpenſations till Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, in dying he died, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was immediately promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; wee heare not much (though ſomething) of the wickedneſſe of ſinne, or the greatneſſe of puniſhment, nor much of a Redeemer: And yet was <hi>Adam</hi> ſaved by faith in Chriſt as well as we; and the ſame way did condemnation ſeize on the unbelievers then as well as now.</p>
               <p>A little after we have more of Chriſt in a promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a good land muſt type forth ſalvation, and Circumciſion was given in token that Chriſt ſhould come of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and then we heare <hi>more of cutting of from the people.</hi> A while after this the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> then <hi>Lightning and thunder ſtreamed from the</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:117308:38"/> 
                  <hi>Mount, fire flaſhed in their faces, blackneſſe of darkneſſe, tempeſt, and the ſound of a trumpet terrified them; yea, then they heard the voice of words, which they were not able to beare, therefore they entreated that they might not be ſpoken to them any more, for they could not endure that which was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea, it made Moſes himſelfe exceedingly feare and ſhake.</hi> Now it was, that which was threatned before, rouſed up it ſelfe in more terrible appearances: Now likewiſe appeares more of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: Prieſts and Divine Service were all inſtituted to hold forth Chriſt, little yet of eternall wrath or life was manifeſted but in ſhadowes: <hi>Curſed be thou in thy basket and ſtore: Bleſſed ſhalt thou be, and eate the fat of the good land:</hi> Of this nature the curſings and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſeemed to be then, yet the ſame way of ſalvation and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then as now.</p>
               <p>But the ſame God that ſpake before ſundry times, and divers manners, hath in theſe laſt daies <hi>ſpoken by his Sonne;</hi> now life and immortality is brought to light by the Goſpell, now the Vaile is rent in twaine, now are <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> both in one eſtate, and now ſoundeth the noiſe of <hi>hell fire, eternall wrath,</hi> the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> and <hi>deſtruction;</hi> now are we delivered from our enemies, that no curſe can come nigh all our dwelling places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law was holy, just and good, how comes it to be done away?</hi>

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all theſe things are changed, the ſickneſſe of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the ſoules health: The labour of the body ſerves to minde us that our reſt is not here: Death in the fleſh ſerves to paſſe us to our reſt and bleſſedneſſe; for <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, for they ſhall reſt from all their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> wiſely <hi>Deſired to be diſſolved that he might be with Chriſt.</hi> Hence he glories in tribulation, which if curſes to him he could not have done.

               <p>I anſwer to this, Firſt, Affirmatively; That God doth afflict his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> people for ſin, yea, his beloved: But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay Afflictions are to them no curſe at all, but a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving correction of a loving Father: not to ſatisfy his wrath (for he hath ſeen the travell of his Son, and is already ſatisfied) but to manifeſt his mercy, it being for his childrens healing, ſafety and proſperity; they rather publiſh his love then his wrath: <hi>For whom he loveth he chaſteneth, and whom be receiveth he ſcourgeth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the ſpirit to the Saints, If you endure chaſtening you are dealt withall as Sonnes; If you are not chaſtiſed, you are baſtards and not ſonnes. Affliction is for their profit, as neceſſary for them as their meate and drink. Before we be afflicted we goe aſtray.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117308:39"/> Afflictions are a fruit of the Fathers love in Chriſts death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, the dyings or markes of Chriſt Jeſus; they are ſent to crucify the ſinnes in us that crucified him; they are as fire, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify, not deſtroy, the gold; they yeild the peaceable fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe (though for the preſent they are not joyous) to them that are exerciſed therein; <hi>If wee ſuffer with him, wee ſhall alſo reigne with him.</hi> And yet we muſt note, that afflictions (though many times they be) yet are not alwaies ſent as a chaſtiſement for ſome particular ſinne, but for the ſhewing forth the power of God; as Chriſt ſpeakes in the caſe of the blinde man. To conclude this of the Law, I ſay we are freed from it as it was a Covenant of works, which was a diſpenſation of God to the Creature, by which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended life to the Creature, but to advance the glory of his his Sonne, in ſhewing them their weakneſſe and ſinfulneſſe. But as for the ſubſtance of the matter contained in the commands, it is I ſay againe, a ſtanding rule to all generations; and he or they that walke not according to it, it is becauſe they have no light in them: To love God and our Neighbour, the ſubſtance of the Law is our duty as well as any others.</p>

               <p>7. BY the death of Chriſt the wall of partition betweene Jewes <note place="margin">The partition wall is broken downe by the death of Chriſt.</note> and Gentiles is broken downe, and all the writings of Ordinances taken out of the way: Before it was ſaid, <hi>In Jeruſalem ſhall they worſhip;</hi> but now, <hi>Neither in this Mountaine, nor in Jeruſalem;</hi> That is to ſay, the Father makes no more difference of places; there is now neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile, Barbarian</hi> nor <hi>Scythian,</hi> bond nor free, Maſter nor Servant, but all are one in Chriſt Jeſus; Now neither Circumciſion nor Un-Circumciſion availeth any thing, but a new Creature.</p>
               <p>8. All types, ſhadowes and figures are now fulfilled. Here I <note place="margin">Types and ſhadowes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Chriſts death.</note> might be large, but I ſhall onely name ſome few particulars; As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Circumciſion held forth Chriſt to come in the fleſh, of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> of the ſeed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and obliged to the keeping of the Law; now is Chriſt come, and the Circumciſion is of the heart, &amp; Chriſt hath fulfilled the Law.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:117308:39"/>
               <p>Secondly, All ſacrifices, peace offerings, ſin offerings, treſpaſſe offerings, are all ended in the body of Chriſt; <hi>He is the Altar; The propitiation; The true living Temple; The habitation of God and the Saints; He is the true</hi> Manna; <hi>The true</hi> Joſhua <hi>or</hi> Jeſus, <hi>that conducts us into the true Land of</hi> Canaan; <hi>He is the</hi> Sampſon, <hi>that by his death deſtroyes his enemies; He is the true</hi> David, <hi>that ſits on the Throne for ever; He is the true Arke of our ſalvation; He is the true Lamb; The Stape Goat; The First borne; The true Prieſt, Prophet, and King; He is the the true Rocke, out of whcih flow living waters; He is the true reſt; He is the Deliverer of his people; He is the true</hi> Joſeph, <hi>that was ſold into a ſtrange land to provide for us againſt a day of ſpirituall famine; He is the true watchman and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of his people:</hi> But of theſe I muſt ſay with our Apoſtle, <hi>I cannot now ſtand to ſpeake particularly.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Sheweth the dignity Christ hath attained through his death; and that in foure particulars.</head>
               <p>THAT we may ſee the excellency of the death of Chriſt, let us conſider it under theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by death he hath conquered death and the devill; for <note place="margin">By death Chriſt hath conqueted death and the Devill.</note> it was impoſſible that he ſhould be held of death: Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>He ſhould ſee Corruption.</hi> The gallant Conquerors of the Kingdomes of the world when they dye they ceaſe to conquer any more; but our Jeſus in dying ſlew death, and him that had the power of death; that is to ſay, the Devill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He by death roſe from the dead: For he, the <hi>ſelfe-ſame that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">By death he roſe from the dead.</note>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:117308:40"/> 
                  <hi>aſcended firſt, deſcended into the loweſt part of the earth,</hi> for he roſe from the dead: Which reſurrection of his hath many glorious effects; I ſhall onely inſtance in two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was the manifeſtation that he was none other but the <note place="margin">The virtue of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Son of God. This made the Rulers acknowledge of a truth that he was the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was the aſſurance to the Saints that he had finiſhed his worke; and therefore is it ſaid, <hi>He was raiſed juſtification:</hi> Had he died, and not riſen from the dead, our faith, preaching, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (and the like) all had beene in vaine; had he not roſe from the dead, death had conquerd him: Now the true ground of our believing, is <hi>his</hi> death that could not be held of death: by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he evidently declared himſelfe to be the Lords Chriſt; Even the ſame body that died roſe from the dead; who ſaid, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By death he aſcended into heaven; For he deſcended that he <note place="margin">Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> might aſcend: He aſcended from the ſtate of infamy, ſhame and contempt, farre above all heavens, into the ſtate of glory of the higheſt glory of God. The fruits of whoſe aſcenſion are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The leading Captivity Captive; the triumphing over all our enemies; Even as a Generall that hath conquered his enemies ſhould carry them openly at his Chariot wheeles; ſo doth our Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus carry all his and our enemies in open triumph.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he aſcended up on high, <hi>He gave gifts unto men, that he might fill all things;</hi> that is to ſay, that all his might be filled with himſelfe; with the new Wine of his ſpirit. Time would faile me to enlarge my ſelfe herein.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By death he ſits at the right hand of God. By the right hand <note place="margin">Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit we enjoy thereby.</note> of God we are not to underſtand, as the ignorant ſort doe, that God hath a right and left hand as we have, but by his right hand is meant Gods greateſt glory, power and dignity. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>till I make thine enemies thy footſtoole.</hi> The effects of which are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ruling over the world and all in it; of which in his Kingly office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The reſt of himſelfe having done his worke; for he having finiſhed his worke is entred into his reſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The aſſurance that we ſhall enter into ours; for as he hath conquered and is ſet downe, ſo ſhall we be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, By death he makes interceſſion for us.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:117308:40"/>
               <p>The interceſſion of Chriſt is his pleading or continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for us to his Father; which pleading we may not by any meanes <note place="margin">Chriſt makes interceſſion for us: what is the virtue thereof.</note> dreame, is a ſpeaking vocally as we doe one to another, but a voice in his bloud; <hi>For his bloud ſpeaketh better things then the bloud of Abel.</hi> Now the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> we know, cryed to heaven for vengeance: But that we may briefly ſee the excellency of Chriſts interceſſion, let us minde,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That his bloud is alwaies preſent before the Lord, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us as Gods remembrancer: it is our Advocate that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pleading our cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It pleades ſatisfaction to be given to the Judge of all; by which we live in continuall ſecurity: So that the ſumme of the dignity Chriſt in dying ariſes to, is his Propheticall and Kingly office, which he executes with much love and fidelity. That he hath obtained all this by death, I will onely give you this demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>That all this is but the perfection of our Jeſus. Now he <hi>was made perfect through ſufferings; for the ſuffering of death he was crowned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. Phil. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and honour; And becauſe he humbled himſelfe, therefore hath God exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and given him a name above every name; that at, or in his name or power, every knce ſhould bow.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus finiſhed (through divine aſſiſtance) the firſt part of the three-fold office of Chriſt, <hi>viz:</hi> his Prieſtly office; I am now come to ſpeake of his Propheticall office; which I ſhall finiſh with much brevity: There being two things for the explication of this office to be minded.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Prophet himſelfe.</item>
                  <item>2. The office or worke of this Prophet.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Concerning the Prophet; It is the Lord Jeſus that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed to become the Teacher of his people. The Prophets under the Law were anointed with oile; Our great Prophet, the Lord Jeſus with the Spirit, he was made full of grace and truth, and God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117308:41"/> the Father raiſed him up, as it was foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and furniſhed him with ſufficient abilities to diſcharge his truſt: For the fulneſſe of wiſedome was in him; therefore is he called, the Councellor; the ſame man that was anointed to be a Prieſt, was anointed to be a Prophet; who was a Prieſtly Prophet, and a Propheticall Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The office of the Prophet is next to be ſpoken to; which is an office given to him of the Father, for the revelation or diſcovering of the great myſteries of the Fathers Kingdome: in which office there are five things to be knowne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The matter diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The light diſcovering.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The rule of diſcovery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The manner of diſcovery or teaching.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The perſons taught.</p>
               <p>The matter diſcovered by this Prophet in generall is this; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">The matter diſcovered is.</note> may be knowne or enjoyed of God by the Creature, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Creature is and ſhall be in relation unto God. Chriſt by his ſacrifice hath obtained for us all that is to be deſired; and as a Prophet, he comes to tell us what he hath done for us; what wee ſhall enjoy by him; what we have done againſt him, and what we ought to returne to him. I ſhall draw forth this to thy view in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall particulars: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is a Prophet diſcovering to us our ſinfulneſſe and <note place="margin">Mans ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> miſery by nature, our nakedneſſe and emptineſſe, our blindneſſe and vanity, for 'tis he that convinces of ſinne. Alas! Wee ſee not our wretched eſtate by ſinne till Chriſt comes to us and ſhewes us the danger of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt diſcovers to his people their happineſſe by <note place="margin">Mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> grace; that though their ſinnes are great, the Fathers love is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Poore man, lies in a dark dungeon till Chriſt come with his light; in a comfortleſſe eſtate, till his eternall ſtate in love be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained him; he it is that reveales to the ſoule the Goſpell or good newes of ſalvation; he comes to the ſoule and tels him his ſinnes are forgiven him: By the ſight of this love the ſoule is taught the greatneſſe of his ſinne, and the infiniteneſſe of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the riches of Gods grace is made to ſhine more clearly; for he convinces the world of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Prophet teaches the ſoules all things to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note place="margin">All things to be believed.</note> even the reſurrection of the body, and everlaſting life: yea the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117308:41"/> Fathers love to him from eternity; yea, this teaches him what God is, and what Chriſt is, and to believe what he reveales, and what ſhall be hereafter; for he convinces the world of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Becauſe I muſt haſten, He teaches the ſoule obedience to <note place="margin">Obedience to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God.</note> obſerve all the commands of Chriſt, the leaſt as well as the greateſt, viſible as well as inviſible, things to be done in earth, as well as to be enjoyed in heaven: he teaches how to behave our ſelves while ſtrangers here, as well as what we ſhall enjoy when we attaine to the City which we now ſeek; which obedience conſiſts in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Love to God; Love to God is that which Chriſt preaches to every ſoule whom he loves; and in teaching him to love God, he teaches him to love God above all, and in all, and all things for his ſake, and to deny all things, and account them as loſſe and dung in compariſon of his God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Love to his Neighbour; Love is the fulfilling of the whole Law; but more of this as God gives further opportunity.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to ſpeake of the light diſcovering, which is the <note place="margin">The light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering is the Spirit.</note> ſpirit of God in Chriſt; Therefore ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>When I goe away, viz:</hi> in the fleſh: <hi>I will ſend you the Spirit, and be ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it to you; he will guide you into all truth.</hi> Therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt ſend forth thy light and thy truth, let them leade mee:</hi> this Spirit is the <hi>Spirit the Comforter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the light,</hi> and <hi>I will teach you:</hi> And it is ſaid, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>That he reveales the myſteries of the Father;</hi> how then ſay you 'tis the Spirit?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I deſire you would conſider theſe three <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are taught by God; and therefore ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Yee ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That we are all taught by Chriſt; therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the true light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We are taught by the Spirit; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Yee have an unction that teacheth you all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe three are not three ſeverall diſtinct lights, but one true light, which Chriſts owne words ſweetly hold forth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All that the Father hath is mine;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you.</hi> Which holds forth this truth that the Father teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his Sonne, <hi>For the fulneſſe of the Father dwels in him;</hi> and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117308:42"/> Sonne now teacheth onely by his Spirit; therefore the <hi>Spirit takes of Chriſt,</hi> to give to them that are his children; So that it remaines cleare, there is but one true light, namely, the light of the Father and the Sonne made manifeſt by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The third thing I propounded is the rule of diſcovery; and that <note place="margin">The rule of diſcovery the Scriptures</note> is the truth of God revealed in the Scriptures; The Scriptures doe declare all that was, that is, and that ſhall be practiſed or enjoyed by any. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> was a ſure guide or rule of old; inſomuch that if any ſpake not according to them, it was becauſe there was no light in them So likewiſe is it a ſure rule now, even the Law and Teſtimony given by the Lord Jeſus, the Son of God, who hath ſpoken in the laſt daies his will to us.</p>
               <p>Now the will of God which is our rule to walke by, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, the Law of God: Where there is no Law there is nothing but diſorder; Chriſt hath given us a ſtanding Law to walk by, which is the Scriptures of truth: <hi>The holy Scriptures,</hi> which the Apoſtle affirmes, <hi>Are able to make the man of God perfect unto ſalvation, through faith in Jeſus.</hi> Many men now adaies are grown ſo wanton, that they may ſinne without controule, deny the Scriptures to be the words or Law of God: But to ſuch ſoules let me ſay, the Heathens will convince them of Atheiſme; for when they once come to deny that, they deny likewiſe the worke of God written in the heart by the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how can you prove the Scriptures to be the words of the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beſides the Teſtimony they beare of themſelves, (which ſome, though carnally and ſenſually judge to be falſe) I ſhall propound theſe few conſiderations to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whatever is written in the heart by nature, is found plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully deſcribed in the Scriptures. By nature man knowes there is a God; that this God is to be worſhipped; and that he ought to live righteouſly; and his conſcience flyes in his face, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of his ſinne againſt God; whereupon he is put upon a way of thinking how he may pleaſe God; theſe things, through his ignorance, are but confuſedly in him; but looke to the Scriptures, all theſe things are handled plainly and diſtinctly; which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable argument (except to them that are ſo ſcared, that they can alſo deny there is a God) that the Scriptures are the very words of God, that thy heart in nature mindes thee, God in his word plainly unfolds to thee.</p>
               <p>Nay further, I will appeale to any man, and challenge the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117308:42"/> ſubtileſt, moſt ingenuous man in the world to tell mee what is good or excellent to be followed or avoided, which may not be clearly demonſtrated from the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon which may ſerve to ſilence thy vaine thoughts, is this, that all men that write of God, or the worſhip of God, are forced to make recourſe to theſe Scriptures, to decide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies among them. Doe not the greateſt Heretiques ſeeme to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their blaſphemies upon the Scripture; which is a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Authority. If the Scriptures were not to be believed above their words, why doe they ſeeke to prove their matter from them? Nay, which ſeemes a wonder to me, theſe very bruits (for I can give them no fitter name) that deny the Scriptures, doe often times bring Scripture to prove their deniall of them: Sometimes they object to us the ſeeming Contradictions that are in them; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us the Word of God cannot contradict it ſelfe: and for this they alleadge the Scriptures that ſay, God cannot lye, and the like: by which doe they not ſet to their ſeales, that God is true, and the Scriptures his word. Yet a little further; let them ſet aſide the Scriptures, and bid them reaſon of any thing, and what will they then ſay? How will they prove what they ſay? Will they prove their aſſertions from ſome undeniable principles? From whence I pray you fetch they their principles? It is either from nature, or from grace: If from nature, that is corrupted; Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane thing? Nature teaches not the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: If from grace, Where is this grace made manifeſt? And if it be not manifeſt, who will believe them? For the proving of doubtfull things is alwaies by things more known, If it be made manifeſt, ſurely then tis in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Well, To conclude this; Conſider that heavenly ſtile, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in reproving as well great and ſmall; that ſweet unity that is there; that majeſty and authority that is to be found there, and in no writing elſe; that almoſt all men that have ever ſeene them, ſtand in admiration of them; which are an evident demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excellency of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there are many things in the Scripture that ſeeme incredible; as</hi> Sampſons <hi>ſtaying ſo many with the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe; and Chriſts being</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>

                  <hi>borne of a Virgin; and</hi> Noahs <hi>Arke; and many more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom doe theſe ſeeme incredible? Doſt thou believe there <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> is a God? If thou doſt, Why ſhouldeſt thou thinke it impoſſible for him to bring to paſſe theſe things? And if he tels us theſe things
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:117308:43"/> are ſo, why ſhall we not believe them? But it may be though mayſt ſay, there are many things that ſeeme to contradict each other: What then? Are they not true, becauſe thy narrow, fooliſh and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heart cannot comprehend it? There are many things in nature which thou canſt give no reaſon of; Why quarrelleſt thou not with them alſo, and with that God that made them? If thou underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly didſt but reade them, I dare ſay thou wouldſt ſay there is not one thing in the whole Scriptures needleſſe, nor any Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Some things in them are figures; ſome hiſtories; ſome lawes, which all hold forth the majeſty, ſoveraignty and excellency of the Lord. I ſhall for the preſent ſay no more of the rule of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but this, That he that ſhall deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is a bruit beaſt without any bounds; yea, he is but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt; that cannot chuſe but deny God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing is, the manner of diſcovery. The light of God <note place="margin">The manner of diſcovery.</note> reveales the myſteries of God: And this is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miniſterially; God diſcovers himſelfe by his Miniſters: but <note place="margin">Miniſterially.</note> more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Plainly; The Lord Jeſus delights to ſpeake after a familiar <note place="margin">Plainly.</note> manner to the ſoule; teaching it by wordes eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt ſpake in Parables, how ſay you then he ſpeakes plainly?</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>To that I anſwer; It is true, there was a time when Chriſt ſpake in Parables; but yet it is worth our obſerving, that he uſed ſuch parables that the very Jewes that heard him, knew whom and what he meant by his Parables. But further, I ſay likewiſe, that Chriſt ſpake afterwards to his Diſciples plainly, &amp; not in parables; which the Diſciples acknowledged, ſaying, <hi>So now thou ſpeakeſt plainly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you looke to the manner of Chriſts ſpeaking, it is moſt plain making uſe of the plaineſt ſimilitudes that could be. Thus did the Apoſtles preach; not with entiſing words of mans wiſedome, but with plaineſſe of ſpeech in demonſtration of the ſpirit and power: Which when I conſider, I cannot but wonder at the impoſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and deceived of this generation, who come with high ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words, and uncouth language, that in truth their words are harder to be underſtood then their matter; who ſpeake as if they deſired rather to have their perſons, wit, eloquence and elocution advanced, then the Goſpell of Jeſus; He is not now among many wanton Chriſtians, thought worthy of hearing, that hath not an art of copying ſome new expreſſions to paint, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117308:43"/> adulterate and counterfeit the truth. Well: I am ſure <hi>Paul</hi> was of another minde, that ſaid, <hi>He had rather ſpeake five words which he underſtood, then ten thouſand in an unknowne tongue.</hi> Theſe men to my underſtanding doe, as if a man minding to ſhew forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proportion of a beautifull man, ſhould build a faire and beautifull <hi>Turret</hi> or <hi>Scaffold</hi> very high, and ſets the man upon it, which indeed <hi>Eclipſes</hi> the beauty of a man, and <hi>fixes</hi> their eyes on the beautifull ſtructure he ſtands upon. They pretend to hold forth Chriſt, but in truth tis their owne words, not Chriſt, that is ſo much doted or admired by theſe Diſciples, of whom, through their faire words, they have made merchandiſe for Satan.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Chriſt teaches the ſoule infallibly there is no guile in his mouth; his words are not yea and nay, but the truth of God; the unqueſtionable truths of God; he ſpeakes not at peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I thinke this is true, I ſuppoſe it to be true, and the like doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full phraſes; but ſaith, This is the voice of the God, of the Lord, of him that cannot lye: Oh bleſſed are all that are thus taught of Jeſus Chriſt; his words are the ſure words of prophecy, whereto wee doe well to give heed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, A word or two to the ſubjects to whom this light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales <note place="margin">The ſubjects to whom this light is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> the matter. I have before ſhowne to be the ſubſtance reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they are two fold, according to the diverſity of the matter revealed.</p>
               <p>Now the matter revealed is, either the myſteries of the Fathers love to a poore ſoule, which is hidden from the wiſe men of the world; and this the true light diſcovers onely to the children of the Kingdome: Or elſe,</p>
               <p>2. The matter revealed is, the truth of God barely and nakedly, as it is in it ſelfe without the ſoules intereſt in it, to whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And in this ſenſe <hi>Saul was among the Prophets;</hi> and the Spirit of God was upon <hi>Balaam,</hi> whereby he knew <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be bleſſed, though himſelfe partook not of that bleſſing: In this ſenſe the ſpirit gives gifts to the rebellious; this is a receiving truth, but not in the love of it; from which a man may utterly fall away.</p>
               <p>Though a man hath all knowledge, yet if he be not a choſen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Father, and have not the underſtanding of the Fathers love, he may, as <hi>Judas,</hi> fall away from his profeſſion, and goe forth and hang himſelfe, as he did; yea he may be a Caſt-away for all that; tis not mans knowledge, but Gods love, that ſaves a ſoule.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:117308:44"/>
               <p>Chriſt many times makes uſe of men for his owne glory; whoſe names are not written in the Lambs booke of life. But it is the portion of the choſen, called, and faithfull ones of God, to be taught ſavingly, knowingly and powerfully; through which teaching the wiſedome of the world in them; and the myſterie of iniquity that before had taken the ſoule captive, are now put to ſilence and to flight: To theſe, his words are as a fire going out of his mouth to the conſumption of that droſſe that remaines in them, whereby they become a pure and refined people.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In that he was the firſt-borne of God; the expreſſe image of his Fathers perſon; <hi>A Sonne begotten in his Fathers likeneſſe.

               <p n="2">2. His Kingdome beſpeakes him altogether worthy; and this <note place="margin">Chriſt hath a Kingdome which is over this world.</note> is threefold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, over this world, a civill Kingdom; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and only Ruler of Princes;</hi> in this Kingdom is his dominion, from one end of the earth to the other; the ſubjects whereof are all men as men, for whoſe uſe are all the Creatures gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that they have a right to them, a propriety in them, and may not by any be defrauded of them; which Kingdome is his, for <hi>He made all things in heaven and earth, and in him they conſist,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Civil lawes, morall lawes, lawes of juſtice and equity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man, whereby every one enjoyes his right without oppreſſion; this is a diſtinct law, a diſtinct region, wherein the Lord Jeſus the Lord of all, adminiſters in a diſtinct manner, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peculiar to his firſt Kingdome, which is over the bodies of men as men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Spirituall lawes, lawes of obedience of life, of joy, peace and righteouſneſſe; which are lawes that the firſt Kingdome are ignorant of; it is of a more high, divine and excellent nature; whoſe ſubjects are not every particular man and woman in the world, as are the ſubjects of the earthly Kingdome, but they are a choſen people out of the world, whoſe lawes are of another nature, to be performed by another principle, after another manner, which the other Kingdome can take no cogniſance of, being lawes to the thoughts, to the ſoule, to the body, to the whole man.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, is the law of love, (if I may ſo call it) which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever in the Kingdome of glory, wherein Saints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the fire of divine love, praiſing and ſinging <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> to the Lord.

This their power is created of God, to which all men, even Saints, conſidered as men, are to be ſubject, <hi>not for wrath, but conſcience ſake.</hi> As for the title of theſe Officers, its not eſſentiall to the office, whether it be of Kings, Lords, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Judges, Emperours, or the like: The worke I ſay is juſtice in things civill.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> his Church, are diſtinct; the lawes of the Saints are not of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or bodily nature, but all ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe the puniſhment of the offences of both are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> divers; the worldly Governours doe refraine the outward man, and puniſh that; but I wonder wherever the Goſpell of Jeſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a bodily puniſhment for the Church to inflict on any: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Saint may be conſidered two waies; either as a man of the world, living as a man juſtly among men, or as called from the world into the profeſſion of Jeſus; which two Kingdomes in no wiſe deſtroy each other; for the firſt of theſe is made ſubject to the laſt, and the laſt perfects the firſt. Now, if a Saint offends the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate by any civill offence, the Magiſtrate may corporally inflict a puniſhment ſutable to his offence; and ſo may the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhments likewiſe, though of another nature; for there is no reall offence againſt the Magiſtrate, but is an offence againſt the Church: but tis not ſo on the contrary.</p>
               <p>And whereas, I ſay, the firſt Kingdome is to be ſubject to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, my meaning is, that Magiſtracy is inferiour to the ſpirituall government of Chriſt in his Church; and though a man be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, he is never the nearer heaven for that; but if he will be ruled as one of Chriſts viſible Church or Kingdome, he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Member thereof; for a Magiſtrate is no Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe God hath furniſhed them both with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> to diſcharge their ſeverall offices without encroaching or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending each on other. Surely the King or Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:117308:46"/> would take it as an high affront, if any ſhould tell them they are not able to governe the the Kingdome without the helpe of <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> I aſſure you it is a greater affront to Jeſus Chriſt, to ſay his Church may not be well ruled without civill Magiſtrates; for this is certaine, that there is a greater diſproportion betweene the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Magiſtrate, and the Church, then betweene the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine.</hi> For the ſubjects of all earthly governments are men as men, and the lawes ought to be all one ſubſtantially, minding the well-being of the naturall man; for whatever tends to the violation of the outward peace and quiet betweene men and men, let the Magiſtrate looke to that, for that is the adequate object of his office. But now the ſubjects of the Church are men called out from men; they are Saints by profeſſion, whoſe whole adminiſtrations are farre different from the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſtian Magistrates may be Church Officers, though others may</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>

                  <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That a Magiſtrate may be a Chriſtian, 'tis true (And Oh that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> all Magiſtrates were Chriſtians) but that a Chriſtian Magiſtrate is no more a Magiſtrate, nor hath more power then a heathen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is as true. Obedience to <hi>Nero</hi> was commanded by <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſurely was not a Chriſtian Magiſtrate: The terme of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, I feare, deceives many ſimple ſoules: I am to yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as well to a Heathen, as a Chriſtian Magiſtrate; for we are commaded to give to <hi>Ceſar the things that are Ceſars, and to Chriſt the things that are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Kingdome of Glory, in it there be no Officers, for God is all in all there; there is no Temple there; nothing but love; the Saints being once glorified Jeſus, are reſigned up to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Chriſt himſelfe becomes ſubject, <hi>That God may be all in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is it for the Kingdome to be reſigned up by Christ to the Father?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; The Kingdome is all the Saints of God that ever were or ſhall be: the reſigning them up to God, is Chriſts giving up all the Saints and his Saints and his rule and authority into the hands of the Father, from whom he received them: as if he ſhould ſay, Father, thou haſt given me people to rule over, to overcome their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to glorify them; Lo I have now done all my worke, I have no more to doe, here is my Kingdome, my children and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I reſigne up all into thy hands. And now the Sonne is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject alſo, that is to ſay, the man Chriſt, the Mediator between God
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117308:46"/> and man, puts off all his robes of power and government, and they are all ſwallowed up in the Godhead; that now there is no more diſpenſation or miniſtration by Jeſus the Mediator: but God the Father, that eternall being, is all in all, that is to ſay, no Ruler appeares but he: the Kingdome of Chriſt is an everlaſting Kingdome, now abiding for ever with the Father, where Chriſt for ever remaines as an elder brother, with this honour, that tis he alone that hath brought us to this dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When ſhall this Kingdome be reſigned up to the Father?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Qu. Sol.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is at the end of all things, when all rule, and all authority, and power, are under him; which ſhall not be till the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body: Therfore ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Tis when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, for he muſt reigne till all his enemies are put under him.</hi> So that if any man ſhall ſay, the Kingdome is now reſigned to the Father, he muſt needs affirme Chriſt ceaſes to reigne, for then muſt the Son be ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſay ſome, though Chriſt may reigne in ſome, yet he may reſigne up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto the Father.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>Poore man! Why laboureſt thou ſo much to ſhake off Chriſts eaſy and delightfull yoake? Why ſtriveſt thou to be out of Chriſts <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> reach? I aſſure thee if thou art not under Chriſts government, thou art under the rule of Satan the God of the world.</p>
               <p>If the Kingdome be reſigned up to the Father, then are all Chriſts enemies ſubdued under his feet, and Chriſt ceaſes to reigne any more; but ſurely all his enemies are not yet ſubdued to him: Haſt thou never an evill thought in thee, no ſinne at all? If thou ſhalt ſay thou haſt not, thou deceiveſt thy ſelfe: but yet if it ſhould be true, Haſt thou no imperfection left? Is thy body dead, and raiſed from the dead? Surely no: But was it true that Chriſt hath never an enemy left in thee, hath he none no where elſe? What meaneth the oppoſition of the world to the Saints? What mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all ſickneſſes and ſorrowes, teares and troubles? Now theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies muſt firſt ſubdued: Chriſt reſignes not up his Kingdome bypeice-meals; but when all his work is done, then cometh the end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Spirituall Officers; as there is a Civill Kingdon e in which are Civill Officers; ſo hath Chriſt a Spirituall Kingdome, which is his Church; in which are Spirituall Officers: of which in the ſecond part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>5. We are in the next place to conſider Chriſts enemies, which hold <note place="margin">Chriſts ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> forth a neceſſity for Chriſt to reigne; and they are ſeverall: yet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117308:47"/> all conſpire in one, the ruine of the Lord Chriſt; which enemies heads I ſhall reduce to theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Satan, the grand enemy of the Lord Jeſus; there is a ſeed of enmity ſowne betweene Chriſt and his generation, <hi>Michael</hi> and <note place="margin">Sathan. Luke. 8. 30.</note> his Angels, and the Devill and his Angels. This is that wicked one whoſe name is <hi>Legion,</hi> (becauſe there are many Devils) that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted Chriſt in the earth, and all that are Chriſts, while on the earth: this is he that compaſſeth all the world, to dethrone Chriſt from his dignity, who is againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sinne; If it were not for ſinne, Satan could doe us no harm, <note place="margin">Sinne.</note> ſinne is that which cauſes man to mourne all the day long; which ſinne is either open or ſecret, errours in doctrine or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wicked men; the wicked Kings and Rulers of the earth; <note place="margin">Wicked men.</note> the men of this world, whoſe eyes are blinded: and ſuch are wee by nature, being <hi>dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes.</hi> We in our owne minds are enemies to him. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> though at difference, could agree together to crucify <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Yea, whatever ſtands in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, is his enemy: which leades us to conſider,</p>
               <p>6. His Victories; theſe, I ſay, proclaime him King; he hath <note place="margin">Chriſts victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> overcome all his enemies: his Victories may admit of a threefold conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as they are atcheived againſt the enemies of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſo hath he conquered the Devill, for he deſtroyed Satan and ſinne: <hi>For he that knew no ſinne was made ſinne for us, and carried our ſinnes away in his owne body, and overcame death, for he could not be held of death, but aſcended from the dead.</hi> Yea, he conquered all his enemies; it was a crucified Jeſus that pricked the Jewes to the heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as they are performed in Saints; which likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <note place="margin">Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the underſtanding</note> of a threefold conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Over their underſtandings; We are all naturally in the dark, ignorant of God; yea, <hi>We ſit in darkneſſe;</hi> yea, <hi>The God of the world hath blinded our eyes:</hi> but now comes Chriſt, and bindes this ſtrong man, and opens our underſtanding, whereby we come to know the <hi>Myſteries which were before hid in God:</hi> therefore is it ſaid of him, <hi>He ſhall give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Over their wils; if Chriſt ſhould never ſo open their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, <note place="margin">Reſcues our wils.</note> and not conquer and reſcue their wils, he would be a Saviour but of ſome part of the man, and ſo would be an imperfect Saviour. Our wils are fattered and chained, they ſeeke nothing but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117308:47"/> vanity all the day long; but now comes the Lord Jeſus as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conquerour, and powerfully reſcues our will from <hi>the hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherein it was made to ſerve,</hi> by Satan and ſinne; and ſo cauſes the ſoule to will the things of God: Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Tis God that worketh in us both to will and to doe, of his good pleaſure.</hi> We natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will nothing but vanity, but through his good pleaſure we are made able to will the glory of God, and life eternall. But methinks I heare ſome demanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have not all men free will to be ſaved?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Qu. Sol.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To which I thus anſwer; If by free will you underſtand a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary deſire or choice of the will from the true underſtanding of ſalvation: I ſay no man, as a meere man in the world, hath any ſuch will; for our will is enſlaved: <hi>We are the ſervants of ſinne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> and tis the alone worke of the ſpirit to renew this will, to reſcue it from the tyranny of Satan; but yet may ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether every man that wils ſalvation may have it?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Qu. Sol.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer; If you meane by willing ſalvation, a deſire of ſalvation, from a true underſtanding of God in Chriſt, which is the hungring after Chriſt: I ſay, whoever wils ſalvation or the Lord Jeſus, let ſuch a ſoule feare not, but boldly goe to, or believe on, or reſt upon, and be confident in Chriſt, <hi>For all that hunger and thirst after righteouſneſſe ſhall be filled.</hi> But the power thus to will or deſire is onely of the Lord, <hi>Who onely worketh to will and doe of his good pleaſure.</hi> Our King Jeſus in the ſalvation of any ſoule, firſt, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his owne excellency, then cauſes mans will, before averſe, to chuſe it: which he doth through the mighty power of his Kingly dignity.</p>
               <p>3. The Lord our King workes upon the affections. We that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Chriſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our affections.</note> had all our joy in the earth, love in, to, and upon the world; whoſe feares were of a carnall nature, are now made able to love Chriſt, delight in Chriſt, rejoice in him, feare him and obey him: and that is performed by him as a mighty King, <hi>That rules in the midſt of his enemies:</hi> whoſe power is irreſiſtible, <hi>For whom the Father foreknew, he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son:</hi> Tis not ſaid, whom he foreknew would believe and be conformable, them he glorified; but whom he fore-knew, he did predeſtinate or fore-appoint, or ordaine, ſhould believe, and be conformable to the image of his Sonne; And <hi>whom he did predeſtinate he called, and whom he called he juſtified, and whom he juſtified he glorified; We love him</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:117308:48"/> 
                  <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> And therefori is it ſaid, <hi>We are tranſlated from the Kingdome of Satan unto the Kingdome of his deare Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may conſider his victories, as atcheived againſt all our enemies as within us, ſo without us, as Satan, Death and Hell, and the like: but I ſhall here onely minde the world the wicked and ungodly thereof thoſe that were fore-ordained of old to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, the world is an open enemy to Jeſus; which appears by the words of God, ſaying, <hi>That enmity was put betweene the Serpents and the Womans ſeed.</hi> Now tis the Lord Chriſt that <hi>Strikes through Kings in the day of his wrath,</hi> and wounds the heads over many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the world be Chriſts enemy, and Chriſt ſuch a mighty and juſt King:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he <hi>is unwilling that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> And becauſe he would have all to be ſaved, that is to ſay, if God ſhould have cut off <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned, or ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all ſinners now, what would become of all the choſen ones of God, that ſhall be begotten of their loynes? Had <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, the great deſigne of God in bringing forth the man Jeſus had been fruſtrate; for he was the Sonne of <hi>Adam.</hi> God would rather the ungodly ſhould be here a long time, then any one of his ſhould periſh: So that I ſay Gods being unwilling that any ſhould periſh, is meant onely of any of thoſe whom he hath ordained life for; which is the ground why he ſuffers the wicked to have a being, and to continue ſo long, and not becauſe Chriſts death was a ſacrifice offered for their ſinnes, as ſome ignorantly ſurmiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe God would exerciſe the faith and patience of his Saints; therefore is it ſaid, when God had foretold, the warre An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſt ſhould make with the Saints, and that he ſhould at length be ledde into Captivity, <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.</hi>

                  </label> is Lord of all, and all power in heaven and earth is given to him: Yet ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>Wee ſee not all things put under him,</hi> that is to ſay, though God hath made him Lord of all, yet we doe not ſee his enemies fully deſtroyed; Wee ſee ſinne and death, which being put under him, muſt be ſubdued to him: Therefore ſaith the Lord to our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footſtole.</hi> Chriſts enemies are his captives, whom as they all banded againſt his perſon, he deſtroyed: yet ſtill rebell againſt him, as in his members, whom he muſt deſtroy; for he muſt reigne till all his enemies of all ſorts be ſubdued unto him.</p>

               <p>And theſe are the weapons that Chriſt armes his Church with; for by their ſufferings the truth is advanced. And herein holds that ſaying true, that the bloud of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Church. <note place="margin">His Word.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By his word; Chriſt when he goeth forth to battell, effects his ends, obtaines victory by the words that proceede out of his mouth.

               </p>
               <p>9. The Lord Jeſus is righteous in his warfare, he is faithfull in rewarding: Now by the rewards of Chriſt we muſt not underſtand <note place="margin">Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> that there is any excellency in the Creature, as his owne, which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117308:49"/> deſerved theſe rewards; but the reward is, of grace, of him that worketh and rewardeth the worke.</p>
               <p>Now beſides the ſweet ſanctification, conſtant ſupplyes, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant experience, and great joyes they are refreſhed withall, while they follow Chriſt, being made faithfull to the death, there are two things as juſt rewards conferred upon them; As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The reſurrection of the body; This is a great priviledge to the Saints; it is the way to life eternall: <hi>Be thou faithfull unto the death</hi> (ſaith the Lord Jeſus) <hi>and I will give thee a crowne of life. He that loſes his life for Chriſts ſake ſhall finde it: He that believeth on mee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will raiſe up at the laſt day.</hi> Now the body that ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, is the ſame <hi>numericall</hi> or <hi>organicall</hi> body that ſuffers with Chriſt, or which men have power to kill (when the ſpirit or ſoule cannot be killed, becauſe it is immortall) ſhall be raiſed up againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But may ſome ſay, how can this be, that the ſame body ſhould be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine</hi>

He hath ſaid, <hi>He will raiſe up thy body at the laſt day:</hi> And who therefore ſhall dare to ſay it, it neither will nor can be.</p>

               <p>That Chriſt Jeſus at his appearing raiſes the ſpirit from death <label type="milestone">

                  </label> to life is true; and that he raiſeth the naturall body from death
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117308:50"/> to life, is as true: the Scriptures ſpeak of a firſt reſurrection; which implyes another reſurrection; for indeed as ſoone as a ſoul is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life, he is riſen with riſen with Chriſt; and ſo is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſimilitude of his reſurrection. But to ſuch who were thus riſen with Chriſt, the Apoſtles preach another reſurrection; <hi>viz.</hi> the reſurrection of the body; as it is ſaid in the <hi>Philippians, Who ſhall change our vile bodies into the faſhion of his owne glorious body;</hi> the ſame body that dyes is raiſed up againe; <hi>The ſame Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Whom yee crucified, hath God raiſed up:</hi> It was the humane body of Chriſt that was crucified or nailed to the Croſſe; and the ſame <hi>body</hi> that was raiſed, who ſaid unto <hi>Thomas</hi> (not believing that Chriſt was riſen) <hi>Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide; and be not faithleſſe, but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>

               <p>But ſay ſome, <hi>It is ſaid, As dyes the beaſt, ſo dyes the man; how then ſay you, man ſhall riſe againe, except the beaſt may likewiſe riſe againe.</hi>

                  <hi>the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea certainly; and let us not wonder at it; there were (as there <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> is now) two ſorts of theſe people that deny the reſurrection of the body, in the dayes of the Apoſtles; As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Sadduces, that utterly deny it; and truly we have many Sadduces in our daies, who ſay there is neither reſurrection, Angell, nor Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:117308:50"/>
               <p>Secondly, Such who ſaid, <hi>the reſurrection is paſt already:</hi> which Doctrine the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is an erring concerning the faith.</hi> To both which ſort, I ſhall onely aske them; if they be riſen againe, how comes it to paſſe there is marrying, and giving in marriage? ſeeing Chriſt ſaith to the Phariſees, <hi>In the reſurrection there is neither marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor giving in marriage:</hi> and ſhall ſay to ſuch that deny the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (with Chriſt) <hi>They erre, not knowing the Scripture, nor the power of God.</hi> The excellency of the bodies reſurrection will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more plainly, if we conſider, that</p>
               <p>2. The Lord Jeſus crownes all his ſouldiers, being raiſed from <note place="margin">Perfection is the priviledge and portion of thoſe that are raiſed from the dead</note> the dead, with perfection; with a crowne of life, of glory, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe in his Throne, giving them an everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where neither feares, teares, nor any manner of ſorrowes, are able to moleſt them.</p>
               <p>Now the excellency of this condition we have not attained; nor are we able to tell what it ſhall be: Therefore <hi>John</hi> ſayes, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, now are we the ſonnes of God, and it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be: but we know, that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Wee ſhall then be fully glorious, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glorious, our ſoules ſhall be filled with God. <hi>Our vile corruptible bodies ſhall be then immortall, incorruptible, ſpirituall and glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures ſay, <hi>Let us, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>againe, Be yee perfect as your Father is perfect: which is a perfection in this life; how ſay you then perfection is not to be attained till the reſurrection of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perfection, according to the Scripture, is taken either <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>Comparatively; and ſo many are called perfect in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that wickedneſſe in the world. Thus <hi>Noah was a perfect man:</hi> Yea, in this ſenſe one Saint is ſaid to be, to know, more perfectly then another: Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, We ſpeake wiſedome to them that are perfect.</hi> He meanes them that were attained to a good degree of knowledge, or to them that were juſtified: and ſo perfection in the Scripture is taken for a perfection, or excellency in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, above that which is to be found in others: perfection ſometimes ſignifies uprightneſſe or ſincerity of heart; and ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hath it, <hi>Pſal. 37. 37. Marke the perfect man, and behold the upright:</hi> And when God ſaith, <hi>Be thou perfect as I am perfect:</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, preſſe forward towards perfection.</p>
               <p>But further; A Saint may be ſaid to be perfect in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpect; as thus he is perfectly freed from wrath and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117308:51"/> and thus in juſtification, is his ſpirit made perfect: and thus <hi>are we compleate in him, who is our fulneſſe.</hi> Now in theſe ſenſes Saints are perfect in this world; but if by perfection you underſtand the moſt abſolute, full and moſt glorious condition that is the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every believer to attaine to; which admits not of any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or infirmity, neither of any increaſe or want, being uncloathed of all corruption, and cloathed with incorruption &amp; immortality.</p>
               <p>I ſay, This is not the portion of any man in this life; that is to ſay, while our naturall bodies and ſoules dwell together; for we muſt firſt dye, or be changed (which is equivalent to a naturall death) before this ſtate of perfection. And thus reaſons <hi>Paul,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Not as though I were already perfect, or had attained unto the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead,</hi> (as ſome men in our daies vainly affirme themſelves to have) <hi>but I preſſe forward.</hi> Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Let as many as be perfect be thus minded.</hi> Behold here perfect men, not already perfect; but preſſe forward towards perfection: This ſeemes to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, but there is no ſuch matter in it; for thoſe that were in a ſenſe perfect, perfect in compariſon of the world, upright and ſincere of heart, having attained to a good degree of knowledge, being freely juſtified, perfectly united in one with the Father and the Sonne, in a way of relation, doe preſſe forward towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; that is to ſay, that full, compleate, incorruptible ſtate of ſoule and body, which they ſhall be inveſted withall in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now if any man, or Saint, ſhall yet ſay he is univerſally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I ſhall demand of him, what is it that is ſo perfect? Whether doe you meane, your ſoule, or body, or both, or neither, but God in both? If you onely meane your ſpirit, then doe I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be univerſally perfect? If any ſay it is, I ask from whence come your paſſions, pride, boaſting, unnaturall affections, unclean thoughts, or the like? But it may be ſome may ſay, We are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with no ſuch things: Well, ſuppoſe you ſay true (which I cannot believe) this is but a perfection of part of the man; for body and ſpirit make up but one man: what the ſpirit doth, it doth in the body, being united to the body; and ſo tis not a full or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall perfection. If thou ſayſt, thy body is perfect, how comes it then to paſſe, that it is ſubject to death? (which naturall death, though ſome have ſaid, ſhould not come nigh them, yet have they beene deceived, and are now in the duſt.) But if you ſay, ſoule and body, the whole man is perrect, how comes it then to paſſe that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117308:51"/> ſuch imperfect actions are committed by them? Can a pure ſweet ſpring ſend forth bitter ſtreames? If you be ſo univerſally perfect, what need you to eate and drink, and to complain of hunger, cold, or ſickneſſe? Such things as theſe with compleate perfection can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together.</p>
               <p>But if thou ſayſt, thou doſt not meane that thy externall body or humane ſoule, are abſolutely and compleatly perfected, but tis God in thee which is perfect, as ſome ſay: then tell me, whether God in thee is thy ſelfe? and ſeeing that thou confeſſeſt that thou waſt once unperfect, who now art perfect; then tell me, whether God was ever unperfect: for if God was not unperfect, then ſay I, tis not God in thee, but thy ſelfe, who art capable from an unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature to be made perfect. I might be large here, in ſhewing the vanity of theſe conceptions, and mans folly, in pretending the enjoyment of perfection, while all men cannot but ſee imperfect actions flowing from him. And how many ſoules are deceived in this vaine opinion, becauſe not able rightly to diſtinguiſh or divide the word of truth: but I muſt paſſe forward.</p>
               <p>I am now come to the laſt thing conſiderable in Chriſts Kingly <note place="margin">Chriſts iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> office; which is, his Judgments: wherein briefly obſerve,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Judge himſelfe; Tis that man Chriſt, whom the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Jewes crucified, <hi>Joh. 5. 29. Who is the Son of man, who is both</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Who is the Judge.</note> 
                  <hi>Judge of quicke and dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The law by which he will judge men; that is, a law of righteouſneſſe, the word of the Goſpell; Jeſus was in the <note place="margin">The law by which Chriſt judges.</note> world preached to the Gentiles to be the Chriſt, the onely Saviour: God the Father gave this record of him, that eternall life was in him, and whoever believed on him ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The world would not believe it, and therefore dyed in their ſinnes in unbeliefe, in that eſtate of wrath; and therefore this Lord, the Judge of all men, condemnes him for rejecting of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in his ſinnes: For know this, if a man doth believe in Chriſt, none of his ſinnes can condemne him; the rule by which his word judges, is according to the deeds done in the fleſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The perſons judged; and they are, <hi>good and bad, juſt and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The perſons who are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                  <hi>unjuſt, quicke and dead, ſmall and great;</hi> and theſe perſons are not, as ſome conceive, onely ſinne and righteouſneſſe, as they are both in a Saint, but they are thoſe men in whom righteouſneſſe is revealed, which makes theſe men to be Saints; or theſe in whom the God of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117308:52"/> this world hath ſole dominion, which are ungodly: Tis the bodies and ſpirits both together; tis <hi>all nations, ſheepe and goats:</hi> therefore is it ſaid, <hi>He will render to every man;</hi> (tis not to every evill or ſinne in man, but to the man in whom evill is) <hi>according to his deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſentence pronounced; and that is two-fold; <note place="margin">The ſentence</note> either,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of joy to the godly; for to them it is occaſion of lifting up their heads for joy; <hi>a time of refreſhing; a time of reſtitution of all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 25. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>things; a time of redemption for their bodies, tis life eternall;</hi> Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The righteous ſhall goe into life eternall;</hi> which is the eſtate of perfection I have before pointed at.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of Terrour to the wicked; and to them it is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eternall puniſhment; <hi>Depart from mee yee curſed:</hi> tis the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord to them, perdition and deſtruction;</hi> yea, <hi>eternall fire;</hi> tis <hi>hell kindled by the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one aske me what hell is, I anſwer, tis the eternall wrath <note place="margin">What hell is.</note> of God kindled in body and ſoule; an abſence of all good; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all miſery; tis a fire that never goeth out; tis a ſtringing worme that never dyeth; tis a conſuming conſumption; a dying death; a conſumption alwaies conſuming, and yet never ceaſes to conſume; a continuall dying, that never dies; tis the ſecond death, that endures for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The time when this judgement ſhall be: In this I ſhall propoſe theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That of that day and houre</hi> (if Chriſt be worthy of beliefe) <note place="margin">The time when the judgment day is.</note> 
                  <hi>knowes no man, no not the Angels in heaven, no not the Son of man himſelfe,</hi> as he was the Son of man; <hi>it comes, as a theefe in the night,</hi> unawares to the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Tis not till the reſurrection of the body; therefore is it called, <hi>The laſt day;</hi> the diſpenſation of Chriſt untill the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is called, <hi>The laſt daies;</hi> but the laſt day, in reſpect of Chriſts judgement, is onely appropriated to that judgement; tis not till the time of ſentence that ſhall be pronounced upon all men, good and bad.</p>
               <p>But ſay ſo me, <hi>The day of judgement is come already; for Christ judges</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>now in the hearts of the Saints, which is the true day of judgement.</hi>

               <p>To this I anſwer; That the word, Judgement, admits of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> conſideration; it is taken either for diſcerning or pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſentence, or condemning; and to ſpeake plainly, tis true Jeſus Chriſt doth judge, that is to ſay, declare againſt ſinne, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117308:52"/> pronounce condemnation as belonging to ſinners, which is, while we are in the fleſh: but this is no where called, the judgement of the laſt day: but this judgement that I ſpeake of, is the execution of ſentence of the righteous Judge for the abſolving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding his Saints, and condemning and puniſhing the world. Now this is not in this life, in the naturall body. Let me freely ask thee, whether now the wicked be puniſhed? Whether they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned now? Surely thou wilt not ſay they are in eternall fire, and have all the torment they ſhall have: now is the time of their jollity, mirth and merriment; the Saints are now in trouble, and the wicked rejoyce: but hearken man what the Lord ſaith, <hi>He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to deliver the righteous, &amp; to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> They are now reſerved till then: the righteous, <hi>who are the children of the reſurrection,</hi> are kept in their graves, as in a ſweet and quiet ſleepe, till the reſurrection; and then ſaith Chriſt to them, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</hi> (though not enjoyed till now) but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſport out the time of this life, muſt die; <hi>for it is appointed for all men once to dye;</hi> and they in death are kept in their graves as in a priſon, and <hi>are raiſed up</hi> (not as a priviledge to them (as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) for better were it for them never to riſe againe) <hi>to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for after death comes judgement:</hi> To whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Goe yee curſed of my Father into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; who are likewiſe kept in chaines to the deſtruction of that day, wherein all ſecrets of all hearts are judged;</hi> which I am ſure is not in this life.</p>
               <p>Thus have I finiſhed, according to the grace given me of God, the three-fold office of Chriſt, who is a Kingly Prieſt, and a Prieſtly King; who is a Propheticall and Kingly Prieſt, and a Prieſtly and Propheticall King, as I may ſo ſay What may be attributed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one office of Chriſt, all concurre in it; for in every worke of Chriſt all his offices have a joint operation. Now in Chriſt is God ſeene in the moſt lively appearances of himſelfe to the Saints; Gods mercy and juſtice both reconciled in Chriſt; his wiſedome and power dwell in him; his brightneſſe and glory live in him: In a word, whatever the Lord is to a ſoule, he is it Chriſt; and it is richly, fully and compleatly in him, <hi>who of God is made unto us, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption.</hi>

               <p>HAving, through the goodneſſe of God, finiſhed my diſcourſe <note place="margin">The worſhip of God as in the inward man conſiſts.</note> of the true knowledge of God, without which nothing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed well unto God; I am now come to ſhew wherein the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that God conſiſts; which is in the ſubjection of the ſpirit unto God; to the will of the Lord; which conſiſts in five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith; By believing in God is God glorified: therefore is it <note place="margin">In Faith, and what true faith is. Rom. 4. 20.</note> ſaid, <hi>We give glory to God in believing:</hi> which faith is either a relying or dependance upon the Lord Jeſus for ſalvation, according to the will of God; or a giving credit to the words of God: <hi>So is faith the evidence of things not ſeene, and the ſubſtance of things hoped for:</hi> that is to ſay, it layes hold on the ſubſtance hoped for, and brings it nigh to the ſoule: The effects of which faith are, <hi>peace with God, victory over the world,</hi> and <hi>life eternall.</hi> The duration of the life of faith, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God is, till <hi>Chriſt come the ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation; for he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. Now the juſt ſhall live by faith; Now,</hi> that is, till Chriſt comes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Prayer; This is a part of ſpirituall worſhip; which prayer <note place="margin">In Prayer; what! true prayer is.</note> is a powring out the ſoule to God in the name and power of the Lord Jeſus by the ſpirit, for the ſupplying of our wants; which prayers acknowledge our relation to God, and Gods ſoveraignty over us: The true prayer of the ſpirit is not a compoſed forme of mans invention, but the breathing of the ſoule by the ſpirit, after the good things of God: this is to worſhip God when we ſeeke to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In feare, reverence and honour; <hi>If I be Maſter,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>where</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In feare and reverence, and what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>is my feare? If I be a Father, where is my honour?</hi> Therefore muſt we <hi>ſerve the Lord with feare, and rejoice before him with trembling.</hi> The true fear of God is the reverent, high and honourable thoughts and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions a ſoule hath of God, as his Lord, Father and Creator, wrought in him by the ſpirit: Therefore we are commanded, to <hi>Feare the Lord and his goodneſſe.</hi> Which feare is no ſlaviſh poſture, but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117308:53"/> a Son-like temper, whereby the ſoule acknowledges all he hath to be from the Lord; and ſo lyes low in his owne apprehenſion, that God may be exalted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Love; This is that which God commands of us, to love <note place="margin">In Love, and what true love is.</note> him, to delight in him; which love to God is the ſtreaming forth of the affections unto God: in which there are theſe ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A true knowledge of God; of which before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſetting a high price of God; valuing him above all things in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A giving up the ſoule to God; the underſtanding to know God; the will to deſire him; the affections to embrace him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The union of his ſpirit with God, the glory of love is union: love affects union, and is not ſatisfied with any thing, till he is united with it. Some ſay, love paſſes, or emits, or ſends forth the ſpirit of the lover into the beloved. I am ſure tis true in divine love, which ſends forth the ſpirit into God: the perfection of which love is when the ſoule hath nothing, enjoyes nothing, but what he hath and enjoyeth from God; when he willeth nothing but what God willeth; when he can truly ſay, <hi>Thy will, and not mine, be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This worſhip conſiſts in praiſe, and ſongs of joy, when wee <note place="margin">In Praiſe, and what true praiſe in the ſpirit is.</note> would honour men; we ſet forth there excellency: a ſoule that truly honours God, rejoices in him, and praiſes him: Now this praiſe of God is the ſoules ſpirituall acknowledging God to be praife-worthy; preferring God in his thoughts in all and above all; ſinging in his heart, making melody to the Lord.</p>
               <p>I doe but touch on theſe things, becauſe I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">What the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip is.</note> on to ſpeake of them as they be the principles or foundation of more viſible appearances of the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>A word or two of the power of this worſhip, that is ſpirituall likewiſe; for tis the power of God; tis not of the firſt creation, but of the ſecond; tis not of generation, but of regeneration; <hi>not of mans will,</hi> nor of mans activity, <hi>but of God that ſheweth mercy; wee are all dead in ſinne;</hi> as void (as naturally in the firſt <hi>Adam)</hi> of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er truly to ſerve God, as a dead man is to eate and drinke: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Chriſt the power of God unto us, who worketh irreſiſtibly in us. <note place="margin">What the true manner of inward worſhip is.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As the power of divine worſhip is ſpirituall, ſo muſt the manner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117308:54"/> be; the heart muſt be in a ſpirituall frame united to God; that is to ſay, in a way of relation unto God, whereby he becomes a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a ſouldier, a friend and Son of God; it muſt be performed in faith, love, feare and reverence: all theſe are faithfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companions: If a man prayes or praiſes God, he muſt do it in faith, love and feare. But to put a period to the firſt part of this diſcourſe, all this ſervice muſt be performed to God as in Chriſt; he that prayes to God muſt ſeeke him as he is to be found in Chriſt; For <hi>tis in him in whom onely the Father is well pleaſed:</hi> God in Chriſt is a Saints reſt, delight, fulneſſe and glory; a Saint by Chriſt goes to God, fals downe before him, rejoyces in him, and lives ſweetly and contentedly in meekneſſe and humility, yet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly in the preſence of the Lord for evermore.</p>
               <p>Here a ſoule lives with God by faith; crying out, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, How long ſhall it be? Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly:</hi> Longing for the appearance of the day of God, who will <hi>render tribulation to every ſoule that obeyes not the Goſpell of God, but eternall life to them that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the death.</hi> Thus much concerning the true worſhip of God, as it conſiſts onely in the ſpirit in the inward man, hid from all men or Saints, having a ſweet entercourſe with God after an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner in the ſpirit.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former part of this Diſcourſe, I have held forth the worſhip that is due unto the Lord, as it conſiſts onely in the inward man; and am now come to ſpeake of the worſhip of God as it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Now the viſible worſhip of God is the ſubjection <note place="margin">What Viſible Worſhip is. 1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> of body and ſoule to the Lord; according to the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſaying, <hi>Glorifie God in your body and ſpirit:</hi> which viſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall be handled under a two-fold conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it conſiſts in the viſible adminiſtration of the Goſpell, and commands of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it conſiſts in conformity to the Goſpell and commands of Chriſt; of both which in order, as the Lord ſhall enable me.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe <hi>(viz:)</hi> the adminiſtration of the Goſpell, and the doctrine thereof, it is two-fold; either to the world, or to Saints: but I ſhall firſt diſcourſe of it as it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to the world; and herein ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What the Goſpell is which is to be preached to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:117308:55"/>
               <p>Secondly, Who are thoſe that are to adminiſter, diſpence or preach this Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The manner how they are to diſpenſe this Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To whom they are to adminiſter or preach this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Goſpell is <hi>glad tydings,</hi> good and joyfull newes to Jewes <note place="margin">What the Goſpell is that is to be preached to the world. Luke 2. 10, 11. Iſaiah 40, 9. 61, 11.</note> and Gentiles, to ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who was born in the City of David,</hi> and is come in the fleſh, dead and riſen againe: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, We preach Christ crucified,</hi> or faſtned or nailed to the Croſſe, <hi>to them that are called, Chriſt the power of God and the wiſedome of God:</hi> Therefore is it called, <hi>the Miniſtry of reconciliation, the grace of God revealed.</hi> Salvation is onely in a crucified Jeſus; <hi>eternall life is in him,</hi> that is the good newes that is to be divulged to poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even Chriſt dying to make attonement for ſinne, to open the way to come to God; and that <hi>Whoſoever believes in this Chriſt ſhall be ſaved, and be raiſed up at the laſt day.</hi> This the Apoſtles preached, which was glad tydings to the ſinfull ſoule; to Publicanes, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, the worſt of ſinners; good newes to a ſpirit enſlaved in ſin; good newes to the body, the naturall body; the reſurrection of which <hi>Paul</hi> preached as good newes by Chriſt, though he was called in queſtion for it: this is the onely Goſpell, the everlaſting Goſpell promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhadowed under the law, revealed now; for grace and immortality are brought to light by Jeſus Chriſt. And of this <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though I Paul, or an Angel from Heaven, ſhould bring any other Goſpell then that I have already preached, and yee have received, let him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Galath. 1. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>be accurſed:</hi> Therefore ſaith he againe, <hi>He that denies Chriſt to come in the fleſh is Anti-Christ.</hi> Which coming in the fleſh is not a coming in our particular bodies of the fleſh; for I can, or another may ſay, Chriſt is not ſo come to thouſands, and never be judged Anti-Chriſts for ſo ſaying, except we may be ſo called for ſpeaking truth; but he is come in the fleſh, that is to ſay, in that particular forme of fleſh he tooke of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which was of the ſame nature of our fleſh, but yet as diſtinct a body from ours, as any of ours is one from another. This Goſpell is a Myſtery made manifeſt, that was hid in God; hid from Ages, yet now <hi>made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, being hidden onely to them that are loſt, whoſe mindes the God of this</hi>

                  <hi>World hath blinded:</hi> Tis not to be revealed any otherwiſe then <hi>Paul</hi> preached it, <hi>For God made manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> is good newes, and a <hi>great myſtery,</hi> yet revealed to the Saints. Thus much for the Goſpel it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:117308:55"/>2. I come next to ſpeake of the Adminiſtrator or Preacher of <note place="margin">Who are the true Miniſters of the Goſpel.</note> this Goſpell; and herein I will minde you, that the Goſpell was preached by Apoſtles, by Evangeliſts, by members of particular Churches, and by ſcattered brethren.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By Diſciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. The twelve are there called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <note place="margin">Diſciples.</note> which he ſent forth to preach the Goſpell; who had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, while with them in the fleſh. So the Seventy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were ſent out by Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Which Diſciples did baptize, <hi>John</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Apoſtles; Theſe Diſciples Chriſt afterwards cals <note place="margin">Apoſtles.</note> Apoſtles, to whom he gave a Commiſſion before his death, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection; upon whom the ſpirit was given <hi>in the forme of fire and cloven tongues;</hi> whoſe worke was now <hi>to beare witneſſe of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and that not onely to the Jewes as they were before his death, but their Commiſſion was enlarged to all the world, Jewes and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſaith <hi>Peter, Muſt one be ordained to be a witneſſe of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Now of the Apoſtles ſome received a Commiſſion by word of mouth from Chriſt in the fleſh, and afterward from him (as riſen from the dead) immediately. But <hi>Mathias</hi> firſt being choſen by the Church, God by lots called him. <hi>Paul</hi> was immediatly called from heaven, who received not the Goſpell of man, nor by man, but from heaven. Theſe in a ſpeciall manner were ſent forth to plant the Goſpell, to plant Churches, to lay the foundation: therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The Saints are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles,</hi> Eph. 2. 20. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have laid the foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, By Evangeliſts; <hi>God hath ſet in his Church ſome Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Evangeliſts.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts. Philip was an Evangeliſt;</hi> that is to ſay, a Preacher of glad tydings, <hi>who was endued with the Spirit,</hi> Act. 21. 10. <hi>Philip went up and downe preaching the Goſpell of Chriſt, baptizing both men and women,</hi> Acts 8. 5. 12. Now the office of an Evangeliſt was not to be exerciſed in a particular Church, but was to be exerciſed in the preaching of the Goſpel in ſeverall places. And thus did <hi>Timothy</hi> (who is commanded to doe the worke of an Evangeliſt) accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Paul,</hi> preaching the Goſpell: And ſo <hi>Titus, Tychicus,</hi> and others went from place to place preaching the Goſpell: of whom wee reade not that they had ſuch a particular call by a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the Apoſtles had; but they were filled with the Spirit. <note place="margin">Members of particular Churches.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, By Members of particular Churches; As for inſtance: <hi>Stephen</hi> who was alſo a Deacon, (by which office, he was not to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117308:56"/> preach to the world) <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 8, 9, 10. Whoſe Commiſſion was this, <hi>That he was full of the ſpirit and power.</hi> And ſo <hi>Philip,</hi> who was at firſt a Member of a particular Church, then a Deacon (being the ſame <hi>Philip,</hi> as I conceive, is called an Evangeliſt, <hi>Acts 21. 10.) He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpell, and did baptize.</hi> Yea <hi>Barnabas went from Jeruſalem to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> being ſent thither by the Church; where he preached. And afterwards the ſame <hi>Barnabas</hi> was by the Church, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the ſpirit, ſeparated from them for to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the Gentiles: who was alſo, in reference to this ſending by the Church, called an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and Laſtly; The Goſpell was preached by ſcattered bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">Scattered brethren preach the Goſpell to the world.</note> 
                  <hi>Acts 8. 4. They that were ſcattered abroad went every where preaching the word;</hi> who preached both to Jewes and Gentiles; whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion I finde onely to be this, <hi>That the power of God carried them forth to it.</hi> His preſence accompanied them, and his bleſſing upon their labours pointed from heaven from whence they came: as it is ſaid, <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them (viz:</hi> thoſe ſcattered brethren which were ſcattered upon the perſecution of <hi>Stephen) and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe ſcattered brethren, ſay ſome, may be ſome of the Apoſtles.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> 
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be ſo, for they were not ſcattered at that time, for they tarried at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts 8. 1. They were all ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus may wee ſee clearly, that one Goſpell was committed to ſeverall ſorts of Chriſtians to preach it to the world, who were all ſent of God, being called of God according to the working of his owne ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We confeſſe</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>that you ſay true, theſe did preach the Goſpell, but</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>all theſe are ceaſed, the Apoſtles dead, Evangeliſts dead, and the brethren who were then gifted and enabled to preach; So that we would now know; whether there be any ſuch Miniſters of the Goſpell in our daies; and if there be, how we may know them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I grant that they are dead, yet I ſay, the faith <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>

               <p>Now to confeſſe Chriſt come in the fleſh, is to preach the Lord Chriſt, the man Chriſt, to be a King, Prieſt and Prophet, to have put an end to all miniſtrations before himſelfe; to have given lawes for his Saints to conforme to; yea, <hi>tis to know the myſtery hid from ages:</hi> therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe preach the Goſpell; he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; Tis true that the Apoſtles did worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> but if you obſerve it, in their Commiſſion, they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as any part of their office: Looke <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> the <note place="margin">Of Miracles.</note> latter ends. Tis true, I finde there this promiſe, that <hi>thoſe that ſhould believe in their word ſhould worke miracles:</hi> which was accompliſhed when the word of God began to ſpread. But however miracles were done by the Apoſtles; and them that believed, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were not eſſentiall unto preaching or believing; for many believed, to whom we finde no miracle exhibited; as the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and <hi>Lydia, whoſe heart God opened at Pauls preaching;</hi> and many more might be named.</p>
               <p>Now if miracles were eſſentiall to believing, then if there be no miracles there is no believing; and if no believing, no ſalvation: So that if miracles be not eſſentiall to believing, neither are they to preaching the Goſpell; for they are as much promiſed to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as to preachers.</p>
               <p>Now miracles were wrought by many that did believe, and ſo is that promiſe already fulfilled: for it was not made to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Are all workers of miracles?</hi> And ſo miracles in truth were for the ſilencing of the world, and making the paſſage more free for the Diſciples to travell up and downe; and upon this account did <hi>Gamaliel</hi> perſwade them to let the Apoſtles alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a miracle was done by them; and yet neither he nor they received the Goſpell: for, notwithſtanding their miracles, they commanded them to preach no more in that name. Neither did their miracles worke upon many that heard them, but rather enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them the more; as in the caſe of Chriſts raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</p>
               <p>But further; if miracles were ſo neceſſary to the preaching of the Goſpell, that the Goſpell cannot be diſpenſed without them; then I ſay, why did <hi>John</hi> doe no miracle, for he preached, and yet did no miracle. Neither doth it at all appeare, that the Diſciples that went abroad preaching the Goſpell after their ſcattring, ever did any miracle. For the true nature of miracles were to uſher in the Goſpell of Chriſt, or Chriſt in the Goſpell to the world. For miracles were never given to continue; for indeed miracles are ſo from the rarity of them, or their ſeldome appearance; which if they ſhould grow common, would ceaſe to be miracles, and become
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117308:57"/> as naturall. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came to deliver <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wrought many miracles: but after the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was eſtabliſhed, we reade not of ſuch uſe of miracles. So Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the firſt beginners of the Kingdome of heaven, that is to ſay, the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this ſtate of the Goſpell, did many miracles; but afterwards we finde not the uſe of them ſo frequent; and <hi>Paul</hi> indeed when he would make manifeſt his miniſtry to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> he tels them not of his miracles, but <hi>The proofe of Chriſt ſpeaking in him,</hi> he told them, <hi>was mighty in them;</hi> and ſo bids them <hi>Examine themſelves whether they were in the faith;</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 3, 5. So that he wils them to conſider what they believed, and if they were in the truth, they knew him to be ſent from Chriſt to them; but if they were not in the truth, then it was no wonder if they were ignorant of Chriſts ſpeaking in him; for the naturall man diſcernes not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, neither can he, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, miracles were not worked by all: for all, as Paul ſaith, are not</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>workers of miracles; but notwithſtanding miracles were wrought when they firſt planted the Churches; and ſince that the Churches have apoſtatiſed, and none have beene found holding the faith: ſo that miracles are againe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the beginning or planting of the Churches of Chriſt againe, as at the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I deſire you to minde, that miracles were <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> wrought to confirme the truth of the Goſpell at firſt; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once confirmed, we are not again to expect new miracles: but the truth we finde already written is a good ground for us to practiſe. <hi>Joſiah</hi> underſtood, by the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the will of God, when there had beene a great apoſtacy of Gods people, and without any new miracle, ſets himſelfe about the worke of the Lord. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> alſo, after the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were carried Captives, <note place="margin">Nehemiah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that, I ſay, tis not miracles, but a command of Chriſt, or a good hand of Chriſt upon a ſoule, diſcovering his duty to him that is the ground of the adminiſtration of Ordinances; which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evident in <hi>Peter,</hi> who finding the Scripture that ſpeakes of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:117308:58"/> ſaying, <hi>Let his habitation be deſolate, and his Biſhorick,</hi> office or <note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> charge, <hi>let another take.</hi> And ſo finding their duty from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preſently ſets upon the matter, to chooſe an Apoſtle in <hi>Judas his ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I may end this Diſcourſe, we are to conſider, that we have the Apoſtles, and the miracles that Jeſus and the Apoſtles wrought with us, that there needs no pleading for Apoſtles againe in the fleſh, nor miracles neither: for by having the Apoſtles, I meane their workes, their writings, their word, their Goſpell, their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which is the whole counſell of God for us. And ſo have we their miracles, that is to ſay, they are ſtill before our eyes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> when they had onely their writings, and not the bodies of either. And according to that ſaying in <hi>John, And many other ſignes, truly, did Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 20. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>which are not written in this Booke: But theſe are written, that yee might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, are all in the Scriptures; which <hi>Through faith in Chriſt Jeſus, are able to make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to every good worke.</hi> So that now for any to expect other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it argues, they finde not, nor feele the power of Chriſt in them by the Spirit, who are likely to meet with miracles, but indeed they are ſuch as Anti-Chriſt ſhall worke to deceive the Nations, who ſhall come, and is come already, <hi>with power, ſignes, and lying wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But certainly ſeeing ſo many pretend to ſpeake by the ſpirit, and to be ſent by</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>the ſpirit, and there is but one true, proper preaching the word of truth; and yet theſe croſſe, oppoſe and contradict each other; how ſhall I know which to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace? there muſt be ſome miracle to confirme the truth from errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly to this I anſwer, That miracles are no certaine ſignes of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> the true Goſpell, nor infallible grounds of judging of it; for Anti-Chriſt ſhall worke miracles; ſo that except we know whether the miracles be true, or fained from Chriſt or Anti-Chriſt, we ſhould be never the nere.</p>
               <p>So that I ſay againe, Firſt, we can never tell which of them is in the truth, except it be revealed to us by the ſpirit of truth, which is onely able truly to judge of miracles, and of the differences of things; that in the midſt of tenne thouſand errours knowes how to ſingle out the truth of Jeſus, being onely of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>So that againe, I deſire thou mayſt not ſeeke <hi>after a ſigne, like a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117308:58"/> and adulterous generation;</hi> left, while with <hi>Herod,</hi> thou wouldſt have Chriſt, but with a deſire to ſee ſome miracle from him, thou falleſt ſhort of Chriſt, and Chriſt worketh none at all before thee, as indeed he, for the moſt part, if not alwaies, refuſed to doe to them that demanded them of him.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding, if thou ſhalt yet ſay, ſurely none may preach except Apoſtles, and them that are ſo ſent, as they were; I ſhall onely ſay this to thee: Thou mayſt as well expect Chriſt to come againe in the fleſh, to call more Apoſtles to beare witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of his reſurrection; which ſurely would be a very darke practiſe, and blinde expectation: Therefore let us remaine with this confidence, that thoſe whom God, by his ſpirit, gives a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to, and enables them to declare it, for the gathering of the Saints into the fellowſhip of the Goſpell, are true approved Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if they be true Miniſters of the Goſpell, why doe they not doe, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; That every one of the Apoſtles did not preach the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> Goſpell to every Creature; but amongſt them ſome were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Apoſtles of the Circumciſion; while <hi>Paul</hi> was a Miniſter or an Apoſtle to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But againe; Some that preached the Goſpell preached it but in ſome particular places; as many brethren that went to ſome Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpecified in the 8. and 11. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> So that a man may be a Miniſter of the Goſpell to the world, though he never goeth out of his owne City or Country. But ſome, as <hi>Paul</hi> and others, were to goe to ſeverall Countryes, who were furniſhed with the gift of tongues for that purpoſe; which gift all that preached the Goſpel had not: neither is the gift of tongues needfull, but for preaching to the perſons of a ſtrange language.</p>
               <p>I am now come to the manner how it muſt be adminiſtred; <note place="margin">How the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is to bee preached. Infallibly.</note> which is,</p>

               <p>To end this Chapter, I ſhall ſpeake a word or two to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <note place="margin">The ſubjects to whom wee muſt preach the Goſpell.</note> to whom good newes is to be preached; which are ſinners as ſinners, enemies as enemies, priſoners as priſoners; he brings liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Captives, righteouſneſſe for ſinners; which is the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of the Lord to ſinners; not that they may continue in ſinne, but that they may be made righteous.

               <p>3.

                  <hi>The Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt and fire, Math.</hi> 3. 11. promiſed by God in <hi>Joel;</hi> by Chriſt, <hi>Acts 1. 5. Yee ſhall be baptized</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>with the Holy Ghost not many daies hence.</hi> Which was fulfilled, <hi>Acts 2. There appeared cloven tongues, like as of fire, and they ſate upon each of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the ſpirit gave them utterance.</hi> This Baptiſme is called, the Baptiſm of the ſpirit, becauſe it was the onely worke of the ſpirit, with which they were filled, called the Baptiſme of fire, becauſe of the operation of the ſpirit; which like fire was a light to them that ſate in darkneſſe; like fire, becauſe of its refining nature, burning up that chaffe and droſſe that was in them, and making them more pure: a Baptiſme of fire, in reſpect of its conſuming nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the man of ſinne: tis a fire, that goeth out of the mouth of the Lord Jeſus, that burnes up, conſumes and deſtroyes the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and chaffe of Antichriſt. Yea, of this Baptiſme it is ſaid, <hi>There ſate cloven tongues, like fire, upon the heads of the Apoſtles:</hi> Which viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly demonſtrated the power of the ſpirit, in giving them the gift of tongues or languages, whereby they could ſpeake to all men in their ſeverall languages wherein they were naturally borne, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 8. Now this was a viſible, glorious, ſpirituall Baptiſme: the proper nature, end and uſe of this, was to crowne the doctrine of Jeſus with a Crowne of glory, to confirme, ſpread abroad to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117308:60"/> all Nations, and exalt the Goſpell of Jeſus, and Chriſt in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p>This was that which amuſed the world; yea, to heare the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpeake with tongues, <hi>they were confounded, amazed and mervailed</hi>

Now this Baptiſme holds forth to us our deſcending into miſery; as if wee were overwhelmed with miſery, and our aſcending from it into glory; Wee (as Chriſt did when he was in the world) muſt take up his Croſſe, and follow him in afflictions; for, <hi>We beare about in our bodies the dyings of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> I might here ſhew you, the ſweet unity, conſent and harmony, that is in theſe Baptiſmes, and wherein they differ; but you will ſee this more fully, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what enſues.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>fire, and of afflictions; but is there not a Baptiſme of the ſpirit beſides that Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt and fire (which, you ſay, conſiſts in new tongues, and miraculous viſible appearances of the ſpirit) which Baptiſme of the ſpirit is the worke of Gods ſpirit upon the heart in believing, and the like; according to that in Titus, We are ſaved by the waſhing of regeneration, &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; Yielding, That we are ſaved by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which hee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> ſhed on us abundantly. But we finde not in the Scriptures, this work of the ſpirit to be called that Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and fire, which is promiſed to believers: Therefore we finde the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz:</hi> of tongues and miracles: which is the Baptiſme of fire, to be promiſed to ſuch as were already renewed: (or ſhould be renewed before they were partakers of thoſe gifts) Therefore ſaith <hi>Peter, Repent and be baptized, and yee ſhall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 2. 38. But if by the Baptiſme of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you meane the dipping or baptizing the ſoule into the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; which is the true myſtery of the Baptiſme of water. That there is ſuch a dipping or baptizing the ſpirit by faith, I owne it, and acknowledge it: though, in truth, I finde this no where to be called, the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt and fire, propheſied of by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and fulfilled in the Apoſtles in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> I might further ſhew you
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117308:61"/> how the word, baptized, is attributed to other things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to cups and veſſels; as it is ſaid, <hi>The Phariſees drinke not, but firſt waſh.</hi> The word in the Greeke is baptize <hi>there cups,</hi> and ſhew you how the Jewes had their baptiſmes or waſhings of ſeverall things. But theſe are not any part of the Baptiſme commanded in the New Teſtament, of which onely I am ſpeaking, neither tend they to my preſent diſcourſe: Therefore I ſhall leave thoſe Jewiſh obſervations, and ſhew you in the next place,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth thing I propounded, that Baptiſme of water was commanded to be preached and practiſed in the New Teſtament; <note place="margin">That Chriſt commanded Baptiſme of water to bee Preached by the Diſciples, and to bee practiſed by the Saints.</note> which I ſhall evidence to you from ſeverall places of Scripture: and firſt from the Commiſſion given to the Diſciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. Saith Chriſt, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth; Go yee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And againe, <hi>Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Goſpell to every Creature, he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now that this Baptiſme is with materiall water, I thus prove.</p>
               <p>If it cannot be meant of any other Baptiſme then of water, it muſt needs be the Baptiſme of water.</p>
               <p>But that it cannot be meant of any other, I ſhall thus make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</p>
               <p>If it be of any other Baptiſme, then it is either of miraculous gifts of fiery tongues or miracles, or elſe of the receiving of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of regeneration or renovation (if I may call that Baptiſme) but that it is not of the firſt, is evident, if we conſider that this follows this Baptiſme here ſpoken of: Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>And theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that believe, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, and worke many miracles:</hi> which is the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt and fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſome may ſay, It is not ſaid thoſe ſignes ſhould follow them that were baptized, but them that believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, it is ſaid thoſe ſignes ſhould <hi>follow them that believe;</hi> Yet ſo, that they ſhould follow ſuch perſons, that believing were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is as true. For if it be denied, that they followed that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme there ſpoken of; then we muſt affirme, they either are the ſame thing with, baptized, or accompany, or goe before it, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it.</p>
               <p>Now if any ſhall make this laſt promiſe to be all one with, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the words muſt run thus: He that believeth, and ſhall work
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117308:61"/> miracles, and ſpeake with tongues, ſhall be ſaved; wherein he wil be much miſtaken: For if you marke the words, it is not ſaid, he that believeth and doth baptize others, ſhall be ſaved; <hi>But he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> In this Baptiſme the man is paſſive, to have an Ordinance adminiſtred upon him by another: but when he ſaith, <hi>Theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that believe; in my name they ſhall caſt out Devils, and ſpeake with new tongues.</hi> Here they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, they are to be Miniſters of the Lord to others.</p>
               <p>When he ſaith, He <hi>that believeth and is baptized;</hi> he ſpeakes of a worke to be done upon the believer: which is evident in <hi>Mathew;</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> The Diſciples of Chriſt were to adminiſter this Ordinance; they were able to doe it: but when he ſaith, thoſe that believe ſhall doe ſuch things as he ſpeakes of, it is a promiſe of the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt and fire to them, wherein their activity ſhould appeare; for they ſhould doe great workes to others, heale others: But as for this Baptiſm of the ſpirit, I ſhall evidence it to follow Baptiſme of water, more fully from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But if any ſay, theſe gifts promiſed, accompany that Baptiſme, then I ſay, they are not the ſame with it, but companions of it; and ſo are truly diſtinct from it.</p>
               <p>And if any ſay, thoſe gifts goe before the Baptiſme here ſpoken of, this is a good demonſtration that they are not the ſame with it.</p>
               <p>But if any ſhall yet ſay, theſe gifts follow the Baptiſme ſpoken of in the alleadged text of <hi>Marke</hi> or <hi>Mathew,</hi> then likewiſe it is cleare, they are not the ſame with it. But further, to put this out of doubt (if poſſible) Conſider;</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles never gave the Holy Ghoſt, but they did baptize; the one they could doe, the other was peculiar to an aſcended Jeſus: Therefore ſaith <hi>John, Hee,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt, ſhall baptize thee with the Holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi> This is his ſole prerogative. Neither doe we ever finde the Apoſtles to be ſaid to have given the Holy Ghoſt; but this, we finde them baptizing in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But-may ſome ſay, The Holy Ghoſt was given by the laying on of the hands of the Apoſtles; and ſo he bids them teach and baptize; that is to ſay, doe <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> you teach, and be you inſtruments, through your miniſtry of baptizing others with the Holy Ghost: So that in this ſenſe they did baptize, as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall in the hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever thou art that argueſt thus, I wiſh onely ſuch a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <label type="milestone">

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:117308:62"/> from thee in this point, as thou now uſeſt: thou ſayſt, the Apoſtles baptized, but this that they did, was onely outward or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: and yet wilt thou deny Baptiſm of water, upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe it it outward or externall. Thou ſayſt they that preached, laid their hands on the Diſciples, and the Holy Ghoſt was given unto them. The Scriptures alſo ſay, they baptized, and the Holy Ghoſt was given. Surely their preaching was onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till applyed by faith: ſo as their preaching was, ſo alſo was the Baptiſme with which they baptized outward, which they only fulfilled; but themſelves prayed to God for to ſend the Holy Ghoſt upon them, who were before baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus; as is undeniably made manifeſt, <hi>Acts 8. verſe</hi> 12. 15, 16, 17. So that if they did baptize in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and yet could not give the Holy Ghoſt, but prayed afterwards for them, that they might receive it: it is very manifeſt, that baptizing in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt or ſpirit, are diſtinct: ſo that indeed all that we finde the Apoſtles doing, is ſomething viſible or externall: they pray, they preach, they lay on hands, and baptize, all theſe as performed by them, are onely outward acts: For <hi>Paul planteth, and Apollo watereth, but God gives the bleſſing:</hi> Yet, notwithſtanding, though the acts of theſe be outward, yet the ſpirit, principle and power, are all ſpirituall. And indeed as divine a power of the Spirit is required in the true baptizing, or being truly baptized with water, according to the Goſpell, as there is in preaching, believing or praying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it may be, the Baptiſme of the ſpirit in the ſecond ſenſe,</hi> viz: <hi>of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> or renovation; according to that in Titus 3. 4. which is meant in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Marke before mentioned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer to this; It cannot be meant of that, becauſe that is the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> ground of the Baptiſme of water, and included in the words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>He that believeth:</hi> For no man can truly believe, but he that hath the ſpirit of God; for the fruit of the ſpirit is faith, and by faith are we renewed: So that if it had beene meant ſo, the words ſhould have beene rendred thus; He that believeth by the ſpirit, and is a believer by the ſpirit, ſhall be ſaved; which is a fruitleſſe, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and uſeleſſe repetition of one, and the ſame thing. So that indeed it cannot truly be interpreted of any other Baptiſme, then a Baptiſme of materiall water.</p>
               <p>And againe; What I have ſaid of the incapacity of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples giving the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, is as true here, they could
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117308:62"/> not, neither did they give this ſpirit at all, either in regeneration, or miraculous appearances, but did baptize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But may ſome yet ſay, You ſpeake of another Baptiſme,</hi> viz: <hi>of afflictions;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>and though it may not be meant of any of the former, yet it may be of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it cannot be meant of this, is apparent; for it was ſuch a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> miniſtration of Baptiſme, that the Diſciples of Chriſt were to bee Adminiſtrators thereof. Now we know the Miniſters of the Goſpel preached not bonds, but liberty, peace, and joy full of glory: the world and the Devill are the authors, adminiſtrators and actors, of troubles, perſecutions and afflictions; and ſo are not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, who acted in this, baptizing divers, but never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But though it may not be underſtood of internall afflictions, yet it may be of</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Conformity to Chriſts death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are conformable to Chriſts death, in believing; for wee, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> through faith, become dead to the world, in believing there is the ſimilitude of Chriſts death and reſurrection in the ſpirit: but this Baptiſme followes believing, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>But if what I have ſaid from this, prove not ſatisfactory to thee; goe along with me a little further, and let us conſider, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinnes, and yee ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He firſt bids them, repent, which is the work onely of the ſpirit in the new birth or regeneration: And what then? And be baptized: with what Baptiſme? With the Baptiſme of water, and yee ſhall receive the Holy Ghoſt. He ſaith not, your Baptiſme is the receiving the Holy Ghoſt, but being baptized, you ſhall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: that is to ſay, of tongues or miracles.</p>
               <p>There is another Scripture yet deſerves our conſideration; which is, <hi>Acts 8. 12, 13. When they believed, Philip preaching the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdome of God; and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized, both men and women. Then Simon himſelfe believed alſo; and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip.</hi> Now would I know what Baptiſme it is that <hi>Simon</hi> was baptized withall? Surely you will not ſay, it was the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt; if you ſhall conſider, <hi>verſe 16. The Holy Ghoſt was then fallen on none of them, for they were onely baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> and afterwards they received the Holy Ghoſt. Anſt if any ſay, it was the ſpirit of regeneration, that cannot be; for <hi>Simon</hi> that was baptized, <hi>was in</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:117308:63"/> 
                  <hi>the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity, whoſe heart was not right in the ſight of God, verſe</hi> 22, 33. So that I ſay, it was a Baptiſme of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall water; a viſible externall Baptiſme upon the profeſſion of his faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, notwithstanding all this, may ſome ſay, Theſe are but arguments, where</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We are not deſtitute of Scriptures to evince this, if their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> may be prevalent: <hi>Philip and the Eunuch came unto a certaine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Eunuch ſaid, here is water, what hindereth but I may be baptized?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8. 36. 38.</note> To whom <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt:</hi> And <hi>ſo they went both into the water, and Philip baptized him.</hi> Which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is materiall water, and not metaphoricall or myſterious, as ſome may conceive: for <hi>Philip</hi> required faith to be in the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and ſo the ſpirit, before he would baptize him with water.</p>
               <p>Yet, to put all out of controverſy, conſider <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and the Gentiles, having received the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Peter</hi> concludes from thence aſſuredly, none ought to forbid them; and makes a challenge to any one, if they could, to ſhew cauſe that they ſhould be denied the Baptiſme of water; and <hi>Commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Which Baptiſme of water was not the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt, but was diſpenſed upon them after they had received that, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. latter end.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>ſaith, I baptize you with water, but he that cometh after me, ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi> So that water Baptiſme is onely <hi>Johns,</hi> and not Chriſts; as ſpirit Baptiſme is onely Chriſts, and not <hi>Johns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I will ſhew you clearly, the Baptiſme of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Sol. Of the unity of Johns and Chriſts Baptiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one. In the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element of water.</note> was Chriſts as well as <hi>Johns;</hi> and that by nnfolding to you the true nature of <hi>Johnes</hi> Baptiſme, and the true nature of Chriſts Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; wherein their unity and difference will appeare: their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is manifeſt:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the element of both was the ſame materiall water; it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> baptized with water; and I have already proved to you, the Saints were baptized into the name of Jeſus with water alſo: <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the reſt were baptized with water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Baptiſme of water, both of Chriſts and <hi>Johns,</hi> came from heaven. Chriſt tels us, <hi>Johns</hi> is from heaven, <hi>Math. 21. 25. The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Both from heaven.</note> 
                  <hi>word of God came to John in the wilderneſſe:</hi> He is ſaid, <hi>To be ſent from God alſo.</hi> So the Baptiſme of water adminiſtred by Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is like wiſe from heaven: Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth; Goe yee therefore, teach and baptize.</hi> It was the power of heaven conferred upon Chriſt, which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and enabled the Diſciples to preach and practiſe the Ordinance of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Both <hi>Johns</hi> and Chriſts Baptiſme pointed at Chriſt, though <note place="margin">Both held forth Chriſt. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſts and Johns baptiſme.</note> under a various conſideration. Thus for their agreement; now I will ſhew wherein they differ: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Baptiſme of water adminiſtred by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, after his reſurrection, was not adminiſtred upon the ſame ground as <hi>Johns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine, upon which his adminiſtration depended, was <note place="margin">They were not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred upon the ſame grounds.</note> not the ſame with that the Apoſtles preached; for <hi>John</hi> held forth a Chriſt to come, to dye, to ſuffer, to take away ſinne; but now the doctrine of the Goſpell is, <hi>That Chriſt is come, dead, riſen, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up to heaven, and ſitteth at Gods right hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>John</hi> baptized perſons believing in a Chriſt to come after
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117308:64"/> him; but now he that ſhall baptize into a Chriſt as not come, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the faith: <hi>For this is the Antichriſt that denies Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, dead and riſen againe.</hi> They preached the Lord crucified, and baptized them that believed in him, who was then dead and riſen from the dead. <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme pointed at remiſſion of ſinnes to be by Jeſus Chriſt; but the Baptiſme of water adminiſtred by the Diſciples of Chriſt, held forth remiſſion of ſinnes already; and they were to be baptized, to manifeſt their ſinnes being pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſubjects of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme were onely Jewes: it is ſaid of him, <hi>All Judea and Jeruſalem came out to be baptized in Jordan:</hi> But Chriſts are, <hi>Go preach the Goſpell to every Creature; viz.</hi> Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, baptizing them. Thus was the Gentiles, with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with water.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That was a preparation to the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt; for he prepared the way of the Lord; but this followes after, as in <hi>Cornelius:</hi> and if by Baptiſme of the ſpirit you meane regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Baptiſme of water alwaies followed that, at-leaſt the profeſſion of it, which is the true ground of viſible adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Commiſſions by which the Baptiſme of water was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed were divers: the one by God to <hi>John</hi> in the wilderneſſe; the other from Chriſt to the Saints being riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, The Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> is alwaies called the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>Iohn;</hi> and no where the Baptiſme of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall finde a diſtinction betweene them; and the Diſciples are ſaid to baptize in the name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A ſecond difference is this, That the Baptiſme of water admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by <hi>Iohn</hi> ceaſed; for he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I muſt decreaſe;</hi> that is <note place="margin">They have not the like continuance.</note> to ſay, my perſon, my office, my miniſtry, muſt all ſtoope to Chriſt, who muſt encreaſe. <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine ceaſed in Chriſt, ſo his Baptiſm; for Chriſt being come, dead and riſen. <hi>Iohn</hi> was not any longer by his miniſtry to prepare his way: and truly if you take away the doctrine upon which any thing is adminiſtred, you likewiſe take away the adminiſtration: but now Chriſts Baptiſme endures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed upon a more ſtrong foundation; Chriſt humbled and exalted, dead and riſen: therefore are the believers who were filled by the Holy Ghoſt, baptized with the Baptiſme of water, in the name of the Lord Jeſus: The continuation whereof I ſhall prove afterwards.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:117308:64"/>
               <p>Thus is it manifeſt, that the Baptiſme of water was as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt, as by <hi>Iohn;</hi> and was not onely <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, as many ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>I baptize you with water, but Christ ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with the ſpirit and fire:</hi> It proves not, that Chriſt did not command his Diſciples to continue baptizing with water: but this it proves, that Chriſts baptiſme was greater then <hi>Iohns: Iohns</hi> was onely water, but Chriſts water and the ſpirit too: I ſay, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Iohns</hi> proves no more that Chriſt hath not a baptiſme of water, then <hi>Pauls</hi> words, ſaying, that <hi>Paul planteth, and Apollo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, but it is God that gives the bleſſing;</hi> proves, that God plants not, nor waters: which would be ſtrange to affirme.</p>
               <p>To conclude this likewiſe, I ſhall onely deſire you to minde this: if the baptiſme of water was onely <hi>Iohns,</hi> and to endure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till ſoules were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt (as thoſe that ſay, <hi>water baptiſme</hi> is onely <hi>Iohns,</hi> affirme) then demand I, how comes it to paſſe, that being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, is uſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> as an undeniable argument, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſhould be baptized with water. Sure this is an undoubted truth, that that diſpenſation, which is the onely ground of putting an end to <hi>Baptiſme of water,</hi> (as they ſay the baptiſme of the ſpirit is) cannot be a true ground to continue it: but <hi>Peter</hi> uſes it as an argument for its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from whence without wreſting the Scriptures, perverting the truth, dazling mens eyes with the bare notions of myſtery, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, life or ſubſtance; we may ſafely conclude, that <hi>baptiſme of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is Chriſts <hi>baptiſme,</hi> as well as <hi>Iohns,</hi> and was <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>practiſed</hi> by the Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus. But leſt we ſhould be cheated or beguiled through the falſe repreſentations of the carnality of this <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> I will, in the next particular, diſcover its great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>6. The way being now ſomething more cleare, I deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; <note place="margin">The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, uſe and end of water Baptiſme.</note> and ſhew you the true nature, uſe and end of this ordinance or <hi>baptiſme,</hi> wherein the true glory of it will <hi>appeare,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the endeavours of men or Devils to ſtaine it: it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the New Teſtament of the Lord Jeſus; it is a part of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſpirituall and heavenly obedience; whoſe uſe and end is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the viſible holding forth the death and reſurrection <note place="margin">It holds forth Chriſts death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiou.</note> of the Lord Jeſus; That <hi>Law-giver,</hi> who hath given us tongues to <hi>ſpeake</hi> of this myſtery, hath given us bodies to <hi>expreſſe</hi> it: for what is our being <hi>overwhelmed</hi> with <hi>water,</hi> but a lively <hi>repreſentation</hi> of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117308:65"/> Chriſts being in the grave, and our aſcending out of the water: what is it, but a fit publication of Chriſts being raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſerves for the exerciſe of our obedience unto the <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſerves for the exerciſe of our faith in the death of <note place="margin">It exerciſes our faith.</note> Chriſt, where we, by faith, ſee our ſelves <hi>dipped</hi> in the glorious myſtery of his death: Therefore are we ſaid, <hi>To be buried with him in Baptiſme.</hi> Some conceive, that is onely meant ſpiritually; but, I ſay, he ſpeakes of the being baptized into his death by faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the viſible Ordinance: for in that may we by faith ſee Chriſt dead, and our life hid in his death: by faith in his death, we ſee our ſelves dead to ſinne; it holds forth our juſtification by Chriſt; the waſhing away of our ſinnes in his death, in his bloud. So likewiſe it ſerves for the exerciſe of our faith in the reſurrection of Chriſt: for as we have beene baptized in his death, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by faith, wee ſee the glory of Chriſts reſurrection; for as Chriſt died and roſe from the dead, ſo we, who are buried viſibly with him in Baptiſme, ſhall be raiſed by him, even as certainly, as we ariſe out of the water, unto life eternall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We are likewiſe, by Baptiſme, planted into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">We are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it into the likeneſſe of Chriſts death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</note> of his death and reſurrection; for as Chriſt died, and was ſurrounded with miſeries, ſo in this Ordinance, by faith, wee ſee our ſufferings to be the dyings of Chriſt in us; and as we ſuffer with him, ſo are we planted into the likeneſſe of his reſurrection. Wee now by this ſee our ſelves planted into the ſimilitude of his death; whereby we dye to the world, to ſinne and vanity: and likewiſe ſee our ſelves riſen with Chriſt, by faith, unto the glory of God, ſeeking the things that are above, where Chriſt now fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of God, in the glory of the majeſty on high. We doe not onely, by this, hold forth Chriſts death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by acting faith in it, that we ſhall receive virtue by it, but ſee our ſelvs alſo planted into the ſame ſimilitude of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and exaltations.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:117308:65"/>
               <p>Fiftly, It is a ſweet and comfortable aſſurance of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">It ſerves for the aſſurance of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body.</note> of our bodies from the grave; <hi>We are buried with him,</hi> and ſhall be raiſed from the grave by him: as ſure as our bodies are raiſed from the water, ſhall our bodies be raiſed from the grave.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, By this they viſibly demonſtrate themſelves to have put <note place="margin">By this we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly put on Chriſt.</note> on Chriſt, <hi>Gal. 3. 27. As many of you as have beene baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> This putting on Chriſt is by faith, by which we are the children of God; but the viſible demonſtration of it is in Baptiſme of water: and by faith in this outward ordinance, have we communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt, having put him on as a garment, to cover our nakedneſſe; as an ornament, to adorne our perſons; as a ſhield and buckler, to ſecure us: we are in this ordinance baptized into Chriſt under a two-fold conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that we are baptized into the love, life, joy, peace, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: we, by faith in that ordinance, may ſee our ſelves encompaſſed about with a love, and united to Chriſt; <hi>For by one ſpirit are wee all baptized into one body, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13. We vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly demonſtrate our ſelves, by Baptiſme, to be of Chriſts ſheepe; as inviſibly by the ſpirit, we are dipped, plunged or intereſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſpirituall body whereof Chriſt is the head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that by baptiſme, we viſibly give up our names to Chriſt, acknowledging him to be our Lord; his will to be our law; his law our life; by this we acknowledge his ſoveraignty, his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: by this we reſigne up our ſelves to him; wearing his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whereby he diſtinguiſhes his people in a ſpeciall manner from the world: Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them in or into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> That is to ſay, by Baptiſme we are conſecrated or ſet apart, unto the Father, Son, and Spirit; and are viſibly baptized into the profeſſion of Jeſus, of the myſtery and ſpirit of Jeſus. This <hi>Paul</hi> explaines, where hee ſaith, <hi>He thankes God he baptized no more of the Corinths,</hi> leſt they ſhould ſay, he baptized them into his name, that is, leſt they ſhould have Idolized him, attributed that to him, which is <hi>proper</hi> to God, leſt they ſhould ſay, they were his Diſciples or his members, or call themſelves by his name.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the end of this, as all other Ordinances, is to glorifie <note place="margin">By this wee glorifie God.</note> God; God will be glorified by thy hands in miniſtring to thy owne, or the Saints neceſſities; by thy foot in carrying thee forth to preach: <hi>For how beautifull are the feet of him that bringeth glad tydings:</hi> by thy ſpirit in believing, by thy ſoule and body in being baptized;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117308:66"/> for we are not our owne, but are bought with a price, that wee ſhould <hi>glorifie God in ſoule, body and ſpirit.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Such who are immediately ſtirred up by God, to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt: thoſe having a power to baptize <hi>into</hi> or <hi>in</hi> the name of Chriſt: of this ſort were the eleven Diſciples, <hi>Marke</hi> ult: <hi>Philip,</hi> who preached and baptized: <hi>Ananias,</hi> who preached to <hi>Paul,</hi> and baptized him: <hi>Peter,</hi> who preached to the Gentiles, and baptized them: <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, who preached and baptized di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such as are ſent forth by the Church of Chriſt; they may preach the Goſpell, and adminiſter this Ordinance: thus was <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas ſent from Jeruſalem to Antioch, being a good man, and full of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Thus was Paul and Barnabas ſeparated by the Church for the worke of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I deſire you to minde this, that the power calling and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling any to preach the Goſpell and baptize, is no other but the ſame power for the nature of it, that carried out, and enabled the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts of old to preach and baptize: I ſay, the Church hath power to appoint or ſeparate any, whom God hath made willing &amp; able to do this as a part of the work of the Lord; for Baptiſme of water is an ordinance, in relation to Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, which is viſible.

               <p>
                  <hi>But may ſome ſay, Many that have profeſſed to be the true adminiſtrators</hi>

                  <hi>of this Ordinance, and have administred it upon ſeverall perſons, doe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: ſo that except there be ſome viſible, miraculous demonſtration between them that doe truly preach the truth, who are really ſent of God; and them that onely ſeeme to be ſo, and in truth are not; we are like to be deceived in the Adminiſtrator, and ſo the Ordinance will be without effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this; Grant that many may fall from what they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> profeſſe, and profeſſe what they doe not really enjoy, and ſeeme to be what they are not: Yet notwithſtanding we need not expect miracles of diſtinction, nor queſtion our Baptiſme; for mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying what they profeſſe, it is neither a new nor a ſtrange thing:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117308:67"/> many in the Apoſtles dayes did ſo; and <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the twelve, fell from his profeſſion and miniſtry too; yet the doctrine that <hi>Judas</hi> was commanded to preach, did not fall in his fall. Suppoſe a wicked man may ſpeake the truth to thee, who waſt ignorant of it, and God ſhould make that truth to be powerfull in thee, and that many ſhould afterward deny it: ſhall their unbeliefe and back-ſliding make the faith of God of none effect? God forbid; So if a man preach, thou oughteſt to be baptized, and thou doſt ſubmit to the will of God, if he denies it, thy Baptiſme is true; for indeed it is not eſſentially neceſſary to the adminiſtration of Ordinance of Baptiſme, that the adminiſtrator ſhould be ſuch a one that ſhall never deny the truth; for if ſo, it muſt be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven, who ſhall continue before we may be aſſured of a true Miniſter, which we have no ground in all the Scripture to expect; neither is that any ground at all for us to ſubmit to that or any miniſtry. Viſible appearances are the ground of viſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and our faith and practiſe is not tyed to the perſons of any, but to the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: So that if any one comes in the name of a Diſciple, preaching the doctrine of Chriſt, and God makes us to ſee it our duty to conforme to his doctrine, wee ſhould not queſtion ſo much his calling, as manifeſt our ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the will God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely add this, to this particular, that I cannot finde, that Gods people were ever made uncapable of doing their duty for want of an adminiſtrator: But the ſame God, that enjoynes the obſervation of a command, likewiſe provides a ſutable way for the execution thereof.</p>
               <p>8. The next thing to be ſpoken to, are the ſubjects of Baptiſme; <note place="margin">Of the true ſubjects of Baptiſme of water.</note> which, without gueſſes, ſuppoſitions, or ſtrained conſequences, we ſhall finde plainly diſcovered to be Saints, viſible profeſſors, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Therefore ſaith the Scriptures, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized:</hi> Baptiſme followes faith, as <hi>Peter</hi> evidently demonſtrated, (when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> asked, <hi>What hindred that he might not be baptized)</hi> ſaying, <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt.</hi> So it is ſaid, that <hi>Criſpus and many Corinthians believed and were baptized:</hi> they are ſuch that <hi>repent and gladly receive the word:</hi> theſe, and theſe onely, are the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſme.</p>

               <p>Theſe late yeares have ſo abounded in this controverſy, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> I might well ſpare my labour of anſwering any other wayes to it then by adviſing thee to conſider what hath beene written by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but, ſeeing it remaines ſtill an objection, I ſhall endeavour briefly to remove it out of thy way; and therefore will ſhew thee, that infants are not the ſubjects of Baptiſme; which I ſhall onely demonſtrate by two Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe perſons are onely to be baptized, whom Chriſt gave <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> 
                  <note place="margin">Againſt infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> a Commiſſion to his Diſciples to baptize.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt gave a Commiſſion to his Diſciples to baptize none but viſible profeſſors of the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Onely profeſſors of faith are to be baptized, and ſo not children, becauſe they cannot profeſſe faith.</p>
               <p>The major, or the former propoſition, is evident; for if they baptized others then Chriſt commanded them, they ſet up an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of their owne, and were guilty of will-worſhip, and taught for <hi>the Doctrines of God their owne traditions.</hi> If any one ſhall deny this, I deſire he would ſhew me in the Scripture, where the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath declared his approbation of any mans ſetting up an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance in his owne houſe, which he himſelfe enjoyned not with the reaſons for ſuch an aſſertion, and we will fully conſider of the matter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is likewiſe cleare, if we conſider the Commiſſion given to his Diſciples to baptize, we ſhall ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons expreſly denominated to be believers: as firſt, that in <hi>Mathew,</hi> where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> From whence many, though exceeding ignorantly, lay a foundation for infant ſprinkling; concluding all nations are to be baptized; and infants are a part of nations: therefore to be baptized, not knowing, they may as well conclude all Heathens, Infidels, Barbarians, Idolaters, and the worſt of men, or any part of the Nations, may be baptized by the ſame argument: but the truth is, theſe words are a cleare deniall of infant Baptiſme; for they are firſt commanded to teach the Nations, and then baptize them; that is to ſay, them that are taught; as it is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is to be referred to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, included in the verb; and that this may appeare to be the cleare minde of the ſpirit, we will ſhew you it cannot be meant otherwiſe; for if he meanes not them that are taught, then they have a command to baptize unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers; which ſurely no man that pretends to know Chriſt, dares to affirme.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:117308:68"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſay ſome, they are to baptize thoſe that they teach, which teaching is</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>their outward declaration of the Word; ſo that to whom they outwardly preach the word they may adminiſter baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer firſt, This is not the true meaning of the word <hi>taught;</hi> for the word ſignifies ſo to teach as to make Diſciples; they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> were to make Diſciples as inſtruments in the hand of God, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers with the Lord, and them they were to baptize; and if it ſhould bemeant to al to whom the Word was to be preached whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they believe or no, this excludes Infants, except we affirme we are to preach the Goſpel to Infants of daies, that are not capable of underſtanding our words, which I think will never be-proved; and as it excludes them, it includes all unbelievers, <hi>who hear the word and obey it not,</hi> which is contrary to truth. Again, in that Scripture in <hi>Marke, Goe preach the Goſpel to every creature, and he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Faith is ſtill put before <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> if any ſhall yet ſay Chriſt gives a Commiſſion to <hi>Baptize</hi> any other then Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, let them ſet down where it was given, and when, and we will ſeriouſly weigh that Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and laſt argument I ſhall at preſent propound (though the firſt alone is ſufficient) againſt Infants <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is this,</p>
               <p>That which confounds the Church and the world making them both one, is altogether unlawfull.</p>
               <p>But Baptiſme of Infants doth confound the Church and the world together, therefore unlawfull.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is evident, and ſo is the ſecond, if we conſider that all men by naturall generation, are but of this world naturall; a naturall man begets a ſonne in his own likeneſſe: no man is born a Saint by virtue of his naturall birth; the children of Believers and unbelievers are all in one ſtate in reſpect of viſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But may ſome ſay, that children of Believers are in the Covenant, and ſo</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>are not of the world; therefore they may be Baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they are in the Covenant, they are either in the Covenant of grace, or ſome outward Covenant of Church Ordinances, if any <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> ſay, they are in the <hi>covenant of grace;</hi> I ſay, they are, all of them ſo, or ſome of them ſo; that all are not ſo, conſider what is ſaid of <hi>Eſau Ro. 9.</hi> and indeed election is no ground of Baptiſme to be admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtred, but profeſſion: but if you ſay they are in an outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; I demand the proofe of ſuch a Covenant in the Goſpel: but if any ſay, there was an outward Covenant of Churchfellowſhip
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:117308:68"/> with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural <hi>ſeed,</hi> ſo now with the natural <hi>ſeed</hi> of all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: be not too haſty in your concluſions, conſider the Scripture, there is now no Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, who are the onely people of <hi>God;</hi> but <hi>if we believe, we are Abrahams children;</hi> ſo that as <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed enjoyed many jewiſh priviledges; ſo now, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed enjoy ſpirituall priviledges: <hi>Abraham</hi> was in a double capacity; as a Father of many Nations in the fleſh, to whom pertained Circumciſion, the giving thelaw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Father of the faithfull, and ſo believers are only his ſeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the promiſe is ſaid to be unto them,</hi> Acts 2. 38. <hi>The promiſe is to you</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>and to your children; therefore if the promiſe be unto them, why may not they have the Seale of the promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider in anſwer to this, two things.</p>
               <p>1. Thoſe to whom the promiſe is made, are commanded, firſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> to repent and be baptized; ſo that if the bare being in the promiſe without reference to faith was a ſufficient ground for the Apoſtle to baptize them; I ſee not to what purpoſe he exhorts them firſt to repent. Secondly, conſider the reſtriction of the promiſe, 'tis even to as <hi>many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> which muſt be reſtrained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, whether you take the promiſe to be meant of remiſſion of ſins; for this is given to no man but upon believing, or if you mean outward ordinances, they are onely for the called; baptiſme, Church fellowſhip, breaking bread, prayer, all are for the called who are onely able to act faith in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But children were circumciſed; and Baptiſme comes in the roome of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> therefore may children be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reaſoning from Circumciſion to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of Infants will not hold, for if you ſay the ground of both is the ſame, and ſay they were circumciſed becauſe in the Covenant, and ſo children <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Baptized:</hi> if by Covenant you mean the promiſe of eternall life, that was not the ground of circumciſing any; for many were in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that were never circumciſed; for in truth 'twas not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but the command of God that was &amp; is the ground of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any Ordinance: but if you ſay, the Covenant was an outward promiſe of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo circumciſion a ſeal of that; it nothing proves children to be <hi>baptized:</hi> for as a fleſhly <hi>promiſe</hi> was made to carnall perſons, yet in a ſenſe, all holy (for <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a holy Nation) ſo a ſpirituall <hi>promiſe</hi> is to ſpirituall chriſtians, the true ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But further, if this outward Covenant, be the ground of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117308:69"/> why then were not females circumciſed as wel as males, except you will deny them to be in the Covenant: but if you ſay, the Covenant was a Covenant of outward Ordinances, of which circumciſion was a ſigne, and thoſe Ordinances were the ground of circumciſion; then likewiſe demand I whether that if this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be a ground of circumciſion, all that are in that Covenant ought not to be circumciſed? if you ſay they ought not, then that is not a ſufficient ground of circumciſion: but if you ſay they ought, then why are not the females circumciſed? except you deny them to have a right to the Covenant, which I judge you will not doe. The truth is, there is nothing more evident then this, that it was and is the command of God; which is, the true and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to adminiſter any Ordinance upon.</p>
               <p>But further, if the Covenant was the ground of it, why was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> circumciſed, who was the child of the Bond-woman, who was caſt out? and why were not believers circumciſed, who were in the Covenant, though not in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family; as <hi>Lot, Job,</hi> and others? much more might be ſaid of this, if that I could now ſtand to enlarge my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet ſome ſay, Circumciſion came in the roome of Baptiſme; and ſo</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>thoſe perſons that might be circumciſed, may alſo be baptized: which proves the Baptiſme of Infants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, I ſay, Firſt, That the Scripture ſaith not, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> Baptiſme came in the roome of Circumciſion; for that place which men uſually urge to prove it, <hi>viz: Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. proves no ſuch matter; for truly if we minde that place, the Apoſtle there ſhewes how that the circumciſion of the fleſh made with hands, is not that which cleanſeth us, but tis the <hi>circumciſion of the heart;</hi> that is to ſay, the cutting off or deſtroying thoſe luſts and corruptions that are in the body of the fleſh; <hi>Which is by the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi> If we ſeriouſly conſider it, we ſhall finde circumciſion ended in Chriſt; for he kept the whole Law, to which circumciſion bound the Jews, and fulfilled it for us: And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſme, wherein alſo yee are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God:</hi> He goeth forward to confirme them in this, that their compleatneſſe was in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, which they held forth in Baptiſme. I profeſſe ſeriouſly, I have weighed that Scripture, and can finde no other ground to judge, it proves Baptiſme to come in the place of circumciſion then this, becauſe Baptiſme followes in the next verſe; which if that were a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117308:69"/> good argument to prove it, we might as well ſay, becauſe in the ſixth verſe of the ſaid 2. of <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> it is written, <hi>As ye have therefore received Chriſt the Lord, ſo walke ye in him;</hi> and in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>Rooted and built up in him, and stabliſhed in the faith,</hi> &amp;c. that to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and built up in Chriſt, comes in the roome and place of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, and ſo walking in Chriſt muſt ceaſe, becauſe we are rooted in Chriſt, which would be ſtrange doctrine: I confeſſe there may be ſome alluſion between baptiſm and Circumciſion, but that the one ſhould anſwer the other in every particular, is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, or that Circumciſion ſucceeds baptiſme, I ſee no proof of it, but rather the contrary; for I ſhall ſhew you cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is no ground at all to baptize infants now, becauſe they were then Circumeeſed; which I thus prove.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, for Circumciſion of infants it was expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, but tis not ſo in the baptiſm of infants.</p>
               <p>Secondly. The male was only to be Circumciſed, but both male and female beleeving in Chriſt, are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The command for Circumciſion was not the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of baptiſme, which is evident, for that thoſe perſons who were circumciſed, were by another commiſſion commanded to be baptized, neither did baptiſme put an end to Circumciſion, for both were in uſe under <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> together: againe the ſubjects of the two miniſtrations are far different; the one a naturall ſee, the other a ſpirituall ſeed, now we know no other ſpirituall ſeed, but beleevers, viſibly profeſſing their faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though we have not an expreſſe command to baptize infants, yet there is</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>a virtuall command in Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, The conformity to a command muſt not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> outgoe the command; now if there be any command in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it binds only according to the extent of Circumciſion, which was only to the males, and to them at eight days old, neither before nor after, ſo that if infants were from thence virtually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be baptized, they muſt be only male infants, and thoſe muſt be baptized on the eight day; but ſurely theſe virtuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are but the ſtreynes of wit, to put a faire gloſſe on a foule matter, to prop up a rotten houſe ready to fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But children were dedicated to the Lord formerly, therefore they may be</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

               <p>There are many other Arguments which are produced for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſme; as that of their being holy: and of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven; and the root is holy, and ſo are the branches with many other; which, in truth, have no force at all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it either a duty, or lawfull to baptize them: at beſt, they conclude but probably, and not demonſtratively; which ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not warrant our practiſe about the adminiſtration of ſuch an Ordinance as Baptiſme is.

This was the practiſe in the Apoſtles daies; and if you will give credit to Authors in the Ages ſucceeding them: therefore ſaith one, <hi>Olim enim qui baptizabantur in profundum aquae, mergebantur:</hi> that is, <hi>Thoſe who heretofore were baptized, were dipped or plunged into a deep water:</hi> Therefore is it ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>Philip and the Eunuch <gap reason="foreign">

But to ſatisfie thee, let me tell thee, I have knowne divers who have ſubmitted to that Ordinance in the extremity of winter, and yet have never beene the worſe: Surely hadſt thou beene a Jew, and beene commanded to circumciſe thy ſelfe, thou mighteſt, by this kinde of reaſoning, have pleaded againſt the command of God, and have ſaid, Lord, why commandeſt thou me to endure ſo much paine? will no eaſier way ſerve thy turne?

It may be ſome of the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> delighting to ſcandalize the juſt ones, may tell thee, they goe naked together into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Oh theſe are but ſcandals; I know not of any ſuch practiſe, nor could ever heare any that had ſo much impudence, as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour proofe of it: which, without controverſy, had any beene knowne to have done ſo, both their names, time and place ſhould have beene printed long before now. This we affirme, that it ought to be done with all modeſty, civility and comelineſſe, with fit garments, which may ſerve to anſwer this objection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this was the practiſe of the Diſciples, and the command of Chriſt to performe it in the ſame manner, is evident, from the nature of the Ordinance; which truly holds forth the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and our being dead and riſen with him: therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Coloſſ. 2. 12. We are buried with him in Baptiſme.</hi> Now a man that is buried, is covered or hid in the grave: ſo that the Baptiſme of water that is inſtituted to hold forth this, muſt be in the ſame manner; perſons are as it were, to be buried under water; which is the moſt lively repreſentation of the death of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>ſo that the death of Chriſt is as well repreſented by ſprinkling as dipping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That Chriſts bloud is called, the bloud of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> ſprinkling; not in reference to Baptiſme, but as it fulfils the type of it; which we ſhall finde expreſſed, <hi>Heb. 12. 24. Moſes ſprinkled the bloud upon the people, which ſprinkling ſanctified to the purifying of the fleſh:</hi> But this typified out the bloud of Jeſus, <hi>ſprinkled upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Heb. 10. 22. Heb. 12. 24.</hi> This held forth the death of Chriſt; but now Baptiſme in a more ſpeciall manner holds forth Chriſts death and buriall, and ſhews him not onely dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo riſen againe: therefore are we ſaid, <hi>To be buried and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with him in Baptiſme, Col.</hi> 2. 12. Which moſt directly, plainly, and nakedly, holds forth the glory of the myſtery of Chriſts death and reſurrection; from whence we may ſafely conclude, it is to be performed by dipping.</p>
               <p>10. The tenth particular concerning Baptiſme, is the principle <note place="margin">The principal leading. forth of Baptiſme.</note> from which a Saint ought to ſubmit to it, but becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117308:72"/> in the former part of this diſcourſe handled the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine worſhip, which worſhip is to be both inward and outward I ſhall ſpeake the leſſe of it here, therefore briefly I ſhall ſhew you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt flow from the knowledge of the nature of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, we muſt not doe things we underſtand not; but muſt be able to behold it, holding forth the nature of Chriſts death and reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt likewiſe know, that we are fit ſubjects for it, wherin we muſt know our ſelves to be beleevers in that Chriſt, whoſe death we repreſent, both which are evident from <hi>Philips</hi> words to the <hi>Eunuch, If thou beleeveſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt,</hi> he ought to know the nature of true faith in that ordinance, and that he himſelf did beleeve in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that truly performes that ordinance muſt know it to be an ordinance of Chriſt, he that doth any thing to Chriſt, and hath not authority from Chriſt, or a command for it, and yet doth it as an ordinance of Chriſt, his worſhip is will-worſhip, his ſervice is not regarded by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As he muſt have a principle of knowledge, faith, and life, ſo muſt he performe it in love to Chriſt, he that receiveth truth, and not in the love of truth, will ſoone fall from the truth which truly I conceive to be the ground why ſo many Profeſſors deny it; it is becauſe they were byaſſed with ſome carnall principle, and were not in love with the truth from the true underſtanding of the truth.</p>
               <p>Having briefly ſpoken to the principle, I ſhall now handle the <note place="margin">The true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> power whereby we are to conforme to it, which is a ſpirituall, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſupernaturall power, whereby the ſoule is enabled to perform the commands of God, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>without me you can doe nothing;</hi> and again ſaith <hi>Paul, I can doe all things through Chriſt, that ſtrengtheneth me;</hi> All <hi>Power,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is given to me, therefore goe yee;</hi> The power that is in Chriſts hand is communicated unto poor creaures, whereby they become conformable unto himſelf.</p>

                  </label> thee as it is preſented to my underſtanding, I deſire thou wouldeſt mind; that power is twofold, either eſſentiall to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:117308:73"/> his generation; or to the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> the Lord from heaven and his generation; now power in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or indeed in the whole creation is that faculty, whereby every thing is enabled to perform its ſeverall office or worke; ſo that there is a naturall power in the Sun to move and to ſhine, and in the fire to burne; ſo in man there is a naturall power to move, or ſit, or eat, or drink, or faſt, and the like: which power in the firſt man admits alſo of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration, either as in innocency; or ſince his fall, while he lies in ſin; in his firſt created ſtate he had a pure naturall power given him, of doing what he would; ſo that mans will miſſed his power, for power is guided naturally by will in man, but this power enabled him to ſerve God in the firſt creation, which power was the power of God in him. But man notwithſtanding this power was through the ſubtilty of the deceiver beguiled; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>the Devil beguiled Eve,</hi> ſo that he fell, and his power was now loſt to any thing which was good, and confined to things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, where in its force is much abated, and its vigour eclipſed; but now is a man dead by nature, or corruption to the things of God; thus much of power in the firſt man: Now power in the ſecond man is that ability where by we are able to ſerve God, fear him, rejoyce in, or conforme to him; now this power is ſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to a Saint, that take it away, you deſtroy his being; a man is not a man, any longer then he hath the power of a man, ſo a Saint is not a Saint without this power; a Saint is an old man renewed in power, life, light, and ſpirit; though let me tell you, this worke is but in part here; ſo that I ſay, a Saint as a Saint hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, it is his life, his portion, whoſe power is the very power of the Almighty; for what the Father hath, is given to Chriſt, and what Chriſt hath, is given to a Saint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If this be true, how comes it to paſſe, that ſo many Saints complaine for</hi>

                  </label> and the reaſon of mans complaining thus, I ſay, is not ſo much for want of power in him, as a Saint, as for the ſtrength of corruption that encounters him, which I ſhall ſet forth plainly by this ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. A man while he is well is able to eate and drink, and ſleepe, and walke, and ſpeake, but being ſet upon with ſome violent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; ſuppoſe a feaver, the ſtone, or the gout; now the man
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117308:73"/> cryes out for ſleep, but his pains are ſo great he cannot ſleep, or fain would walke, but the gout prevents him; now I ſay the proper reaſon, why he cannot walke, is not becauſe he hath not as a man, a power to walke, but becauſe his naturall power is obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through the violency of his diſeaſe, yet thus far 'tis true that a man hath not a power, as conſidered diſeaſed, but this diſeaſe is preternaturall or contrary to nature; ſo I ſay it fares with a Saint, as a Saint in his right temper, he can move and run the wayes of Gods commands, but meeting with the oppoſition of a body of ſin, or death, he cryes out with <hi>Paul, who ſhall deliver me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Through the violence of temptation, a Saint may ſlip or fal, he may be for a time led captive, but this is not properly for want of power, as a Saint, but becauſe of his temptations or enemies, which makes them complain of the ſtrength of the wicked one.</p>
               <p>But further I ſay, the reaſon of Saints complaining, or being ſometimes overcome for a time, is not for want of power, for all the power that Chriſt hath is theirs, but for want of faith in that power, for by faith, we lay hold on that power, <hi>by which we overcome the world,</hi> our ſtrength is to lay hold on the Lord; did we know our ſtrength, it would appeare to be no other, but the ſtrength of Chriſt: when <hi>Paul</hi> had beene in a long conflict, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. with the fleſh, he cryed, out till he lookt to Chriſt, then ſayes he, <hi>thanks be to God who hath delivered me.</hi> To this I have already ſaid, I ſhall adde this, that though power is eſſentiall to the being of a man, or any creature, or a Saint, yet without a conſtant ſupply of power or influence, or virtue from the Lord, it ſoone Loſeth or forgoeth its courſe; the Sun though naturally it is in continuall motion, yet at Gods command, it ſtands ſtill; without a continual ſupply from Chriſt, we can doe nothing, if God doe not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe a continuall influence of his preſence and his power, to the naturall man he dies; ſo if God withdrawes the ſweet influence of his power upon us or in us, how ſoone doe we fall, a Saint hath power, but knowes not how to exerciſe it, he hath power as he is a new creature, but ſomtimes cannot exerciſe it through a diſtemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But doe you judge that the reaſon why men in our dayes doe not ſubmit to</hi>

                  </label> not ſubmit to truth, is, not ſo much for the want of a ſpirituall power, if they be Saints, as for want of light, yet I judge ſome may ſee a thing, and not conforme to it, by reaſon of feare or worldly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117308:74"/> reſpects, I confeſſe, I cannot but wonder to thinke any one ſhould be cleare in their judgements, that God had commanded any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act to be done by them, and yet ſhould ſay they want po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, except they acknowledge it to be from a temptation, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in them, and ſo their burden; it is true <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid, <hi>he knew not how to do what was good,</hi> but it makes him cry out; the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a combate with his enemies; but for any Saint to pretend a want of power, and feeles nothing hindring him, or fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; I muſt be bold to ſay to him, tis through the ſubtilty of the evill one, whereby he is become careleſſe and dead, through the World; or elſe expects what he is like never to finde; viz. an extraordinary power, he knowes not what, conſidering that no other power is needfull to carry one forth to his duty, then that which doth accompliſh or fulfill it, if a man ſhould be hungry, and yet expect another power from heaven to carry him forth to eat, then that naturall power he is created in, would not every man judge him not in hjs right mind? So I ſay here, who ever expects any extraordinary power, whither he will or no (more then what is created in him in the new creation, in the Lord Jeſus) to carry him forth to doe his duty, when diſcovered to him, may for ought I know miſſe his expectation; and let all ſuch ſearch their hearts, with a ſpirituall candle, and I beleeve they will find it to be ſelf, world, carnall reaſon, and Satans ſuggeſtions, which ſet up themſelves in their hearts, and then they cry out they want po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, they want power; oh conſider, if Will, I ſay, if Will be not abſent alſo; for he that Willeth to doe his duty, and deſires to be made conformable, ſurely God will enable him; that which I have ſaid, concerning Power in this, is true in any other command of Chriſt, for us to ſerve and keepe.</p>

For the perfecting of the Saints, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> From whence wee may obſerve, that Chriſt hath placed ſuch officers in his Church, which is all his people to the end of the world, that may be inſtruments to make all the Saints one perfect man. Now all Saints make not up this perfect man, till they are all gathered together into unity: That which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 39, 40. of the Fathers: <hi>They received not the promiſes, God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> Perfection, as I have before in the firſt part demonſtrated, is not by parts, but of all together; the Fathers without the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles without us, and we without thoſe that are to come after us, ſhall not be made perfect: Now, till that time wherein we ſhall attaine unto the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſts fulneſſe, the Lord hath placed in his Church Apoſtles, &amp;c. which Church was not any particular Church in whom all theſe officers or gifts were placed; but all Churches, or the Church in all ages; according to that of <hi>Paul, I, as a wiſe maſter builder, have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon:</hi> And therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The Saints are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone.</hi> Now the Apoſtles and Prophets are the foundation of the whole building, as in their daies, ſo in our daies; and now, what have we to doe, but to build on the ſame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Againe, Conſider what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>And I ſay alſo unto thee, that thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> Now the Church of Chriſt were a company of Diſciples baptized, profeſſing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, as I ſhall ſhew more clearly afterwards, Now againſt this Church the gates of hell ſhould not prevaile, becauſe it was built upon a Rock.</p>
               <p>Many thinke the meaning of that Rock to be Chriſt; others judg it to be <hi>Peter:</hi> but, for my part, I believe it to be meant of neither, excluding the other, but of both: for Chriſt is the true foundation; <hi>For no other foundation can any man lay, then that which is already laid, even the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Yet I ſay alſo, Chriſt is not called a foundation, but in reference to his doctrine given to <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them firſt; who are alſo ſaid to be the foundation; they, as inſtruments in Chriſts hand: Chriſt, as the fountaine and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

               </p>
               <p>But yet to evince this more fully, conſider that the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles, is the onely word to be preached, for faith and obedience in all generations: therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe onely, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me alſo through their word, John</hi> 17. 20. The word of God preached by them, and not their perſons; is expreſſed by Chriſt to be the ground of our faith that believe now; to whom and to all that ſhall believe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, his prayer extends. Againe, ſaith <hi>Paul, As we have ſaid before, ſo ſay I now againe, If any man preach any other Goſpell unto you, then that we have preached, and you have received, though it be an Angell from heaven, let him be accurſed, Galath.</hi> 1. 8, 9. Therefore is the Goſpell called, <hi>The everlaſting Goſpell, Rev.</hi> 14. 6. Now the word that the Apoſtles preached, is that which was given to them by Chriſt; <hi>Goe preach the Goſpell, he that believeth and is baptized;</hi> this is to be held forth, as the word of God, <hi>To the end of the world.</hi> The time from Chriſt to the end of the world, is <hi>The laſt daies, wherein Chriſt himſelfe hath ſpoken to us, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Who by this diſpenſation changed the old Prieſthood and Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. Now he did not deſtroy them, as evill, but changed them: for the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> he eſtabliſhed his own by death: for the law of Ceremonies pointing out a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, he eſtabliſhed baptiſme, and breaking of bread, to hold forth the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his Prieſthood in his death; who is already come, dead and riſen againe.</p>
               <p>Now as long as the Prieſthood of Chriſt remaines, ſo long muſt the Law remaine; for there is no Prieſthood without a Law.</p>
               <p>The life of obedience is required till Chriſt coming: therfore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Yee know not in what houre your Lord ſhall come: therefore watch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:117308:76"/> But leſt any ſhould ſay, the exhortation concernes not us, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all; Watch:</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the judgments of God to <hi>Iſrael, Now all theſe things hapned to them for enſamples, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11. So are they for our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and the Apoſtles doctrine our rule: therefore he ſaith to <hi>Timothy, And the things that thou haſt heard of mee among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Let thoſe that thinke the commands of the Apoſtles onely concerne that generation, conſider this Scripture: Yea, Baptiſme is ſo farre from being ceaſed, that it is called, <hi>One of the firſt principles of Religion, Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Now ſurely if you take away that, you may as well take away Religion alſo; and how you may wave that without bringing in another Religion with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I underſtand not.</p>
               <p>But if any ſay yet, all this ſatisfies not, then I ſhall demand, what ground have any to prove its removall out of the way: for this is certaine, no diſpenſation given by Chriſt was ever removed, but by the bringing in of ſome other: And Chriſt hath now given out his lawes, and will give out no other; but it is high time to hear what is ſaid againſt it, which I ſhall willingly doe.</p>

                  <hi>the Father: But the houre cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: which is an argument, that Baptiſm of water is no part of the worſhip of God; for that is outward, and God will be worſhipped in ſpirit.

               <p>In anſwer to this, I deſire you to minde, that Chriſt doth not at <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Now Chriſt doth not ſimply deny the worſhipping of God at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for we know the Churches worſhipped God in their ſpirits at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after Chriſts death; but prophecyes of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of that legall and ceremoniall worſhip of the Jewes, which was tyed to one place above another: and indeed the worſhip of God under the Old Teſtament, was in compariſon of the worſhip of the Goſpell, fleſhly or carnall (not ſinfull) whereby they were tyed to many ſacrifices and weary journies, in going up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to worſhip: But now there is great liberty and freedome, wherein they profeſſe God in ipirit: So that to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth, is to worſhip him after a ſpirituall manner, from a ſpirituall principle, in oppoſition to that legall ſtate: wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> cals himſelfe, a miniſter of the ſpirit, and not of the letter: Neither doth that place at all deny outward Baptiſme: for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The houre is already come, when thoſe that worſhip God worſhip him in ſpirit and truth.</hi> When you will not deny Baptiſme of water to be in uſe; neither can a man truly worſhip God in any ordinance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he worſhip God in the ſpirit.</p>

               <p>That the Apoſtles and Diſciples did practiſe baptiſme I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <label type="milestone">

                  </label> proved, and not upon <hi>Johns,</hi> but Chriſts accompt: And I ſay again, they did it as a command from Chriſt; for if they had done it only as a Ceremony, how comes it to paſſe <hi>Peter</hi> commands the Gentiles to be baptized, who were ignorant of <hi>Iohns baptiſme,</hi> and how comes it in the Diſciples Commiſſion as I have more largely before proved it to be: Again, if it was only practiſed as a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I deſire thou wouldeſt ſhew me, where, how or when this Ceremony ended, ſurely 'twas not by fire baptiſme as is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Yea, this is evident all Ceremonies that pointed at a Chriſt to come, ceaſed in Chriſt, but baptiſme as I have before proved, hath its inſtitution from Chriſt, as riſen from the dead; but for a more clear and diſtinct anſwer, I ſay, it is true that the Apoſtle did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Goſpel, yet notwithſtanding the ground or accompt whereupon he circumciſed, is farre different from the ground of the adminiſtration of baptiſme, for if you conſider it you will finde that <hi>Paul</hi> did not circumciſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> but upon the deſire of the Elders of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of the <hi>Jewes, Paul</hi> being to goe to them, that he might have the more advantage to gaine upon them, did this; for if you obſerve it, <hi>Timothy's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Jew,</hi> and ſo of right he ought to be circumciſed; <hi>Paul</hi> had the greater care to doe it, leaſt they ſhould have refuſed to admit him into their company. But oh, how far different was the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of baptiſme, performed by virtue of Chriſts command, as I have plainly proved before, not to pleaſe any but in obedience to Chriſt. Again, this was only once, and only to one, that we read of, practiſed. For afterward when they would have <hi>Titus</hi> to be circumciſed <hi>Paul</hi> would not give way to it, no not at all, &amp; when the <hi>Galathians</hi> pleaded for it, he expreſly told them, <hi>if they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Chriſt ſhould Profit them nothing:</hi> Now doe I demand of thee to ſhew me, where the Scripture ſaith that baptiſm was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to pleaſe man, or where you finde the Lord by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture forbidding the uſe of it, or diſannulling the practiſe of it: So that for any one to conclude baptiſm was uſed, becauſe it was a ceremony, that ought, but could not eaſily be laid down, is but a bare affirmation, which hath no colour of truth or proofe; and if any one ſhall affirme it is ſo, I pray him in love to give me the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:117308:79"/> grounds and reaſons from the Scriptures for ſuch an aſſertion, to which I here promiſe in the ſtrength of the Lord to returne a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer.</p>

               <p>I have already proved that the Apoſtles did not by any act of <label type="milestone">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:117308:79"/> Chriſt is not but as the Father and Spirit are in him: So that no man can baptize into the name of the Lord Ieſus, but he doth it into the name of the Father, Son, &amp; Spirit, but if you ſay the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uſed not that form of words in baptiſm, viz. <hi>I Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> I ſay alſo no man is bound to uſe them, but ought to baptize it in that name, expreſſing, what he doth either in thoſe or other words.</p>

                  <hi>none of them, but few families; and ſaith, he was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Goſpell, now if Christ had given a Commiſſion to them, ſo to doe,</hi> Paul <hi>very ill obſerved it, that baptized ſo few; but certainly no ſuch Commiſſion was given, for if there had, how could</hi> Paul <hi>truly ſay, I was not ſent to baptize, which ſurely will not eaſily be anſwered.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.</p>

                  </label> ſtrength, from which I fear many honeſt hearts take advantage to ſtrengthen them in their apprehenſions againſt this Ordinance, but the Scripture, being truly weighed in the ballance of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this objection will be found light; the truth whereof, that it may appear, conſider the perſons to whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, the ground of his ſpeaking, and the end of his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Perſons to whom he wrote were the <hi>Corinths,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>I thank God I Baptized none of you,</hi> from whence we may not conclude he baptiſed no others.</p>
               <p>2. The ground whereupon he wrote theſe Words was, the carnall owning of themſelves after men, one ſaying he was <hi>of Paul, another of Apollos;</hi> thoſe Perſons who did baptize them, were owned by them, in a way of diſtinction, calling themſelves by their names.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The end of his words which was to knit them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he endeavours to effect by two arguments: Firſt, by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:117308:80"/> telling of them, they were not baptized into his name, neither was he crucified for them, he died not for them, neither were they <hi>Baptized</hi> into his death; Wherefore it was a very carnall thing for them ſo to be divided, whoſe diviſions made him to rejoyce, that he had <hi>baptized</hi> no more, for this reaſon, <hi>leſt they ſhould ſay, they were baptized into his own name;</hi> he doth not here at the leaſt deny the <hi>baptiſme</hi> of Water, but his words if you obſerve them are a cleere proofe that the <hi>Corinths</hi> were all <hi>baptiſed,</hi> though not into <hi>Pauls</hi> name, yet into Chriſts name, for ſaith he, <hi>I baptized none of you,</hi> but ſuch and ſuch; implying others had <hi>baptized</hi> them, for in the <hi>Acts</hi> it is ſaid, many <hi>Corinthians</hi> beleeved and were <hi>baptized. Acts.</hi> 18. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he might deſtroy their carnall reaſonings in ſetting up <hi>baptiſme</hi> ſo much in a way of oppoſition one to another and againſt Chriſt himſelfe, he tels them <hi>Christ ſent him not to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> Which words are comparatively to be underſtood, for Chriſt did chiefly and principally ſend him to preach the Goſpel, ſuch manner of ſpeaking we ſhall finde uſuall therefore when the Iſraelites rejected <hi>Samnel</hi> and would have a King, God ſaith to <hi>Samuel, they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them,</hi> which words are to be underſtood that the greateſt offence was committed againſt the Lord, ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother expreſſion is that in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> where God ſaith, <hi>I ſpake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning burnt-offerings, or ſacrifices: But this thing commanded I them, ſaying, obey my voyce.</hi> Now we know God did command them to offer ſacrifices, but that was not the chiefe thing commanded, in compariſon of the obedience of the heart they were not commanded. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 22, 23. and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. 7. <hi>I have planted, Apollo watered,</hi> and yet immediately he tels them, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that planted, nor he that watered were any thing,</hi> that is to ſay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of the Lord; for otherwiſe they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for he cals himſelf <hi>a wiſe maſter builder,</hi> in this we may ſee the wiſdome of God, when any ſoule extolls any thing beyond its Sphere, that, the Lord layes as it were low; <hi>Iames</hi> ſaw <hi>many</hi> exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, and ſleighting works, he prefers works, and tels them a man is juſtified by workes; when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the <hi>Galathians</hi> advancing works, he throwes them downe, and ranks them with loſſe and dung; ſo here when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the <hi>Corinths</hi> exalting him and others, becauſe they were baptized by them, he reproveth them

The Apoſtles preached faith and Baptiſme, but indeed were not able to baptize all with their owne hands, but had many brethren accompanying them to helpe them in that worke: as is evident in the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> preaching to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.</p>

And whereas you ſay, ſhadowes are done away, I would fain ſee that Scripture, which ſaith, Baptiſme is ſuch a ſhadow which is done away: thus I finde the Jewes Ceremonies were called ſhadowes of Chriſt, and were done away in Chriſt: but where to finde a footing for the proofe of Baptiſme, being as yet done away; I profeſſe I cannot imagine, if you mean that in the 2. of <hi>Solomons Song,</hi> That is but a deſire of the Spouſe for Chriſt to turn to her, till they ſhould flyaway; which ſtate we daily long for, that <hi>We may ſee Ieſus face to face, who ſee now through a glaſſe darkely.</hi> And whereas you ſay, the ſtate of the Church was then imperfect, but now perfect: Alas! Their eſtate ſurely was more perfect then ours; neither yet can any man make it to appear in any one thing, wherein we tranſcend them, whether you mean in gifts, revelations, parts, wiſedome or knowledge: Conſider <hi>Paul</hi> abounded in all, and was ſo wrapt up with viſions, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the body, or out, he could not tell; yet he cryes, <hi>We ſee but in part, and I have not already attained, but preſſe forward.</hi>

                  <hi>ſay, Baptiſme was onely uſed in the infancy of the Church; for we finde not the Apoſtles preſſing of it afterwards, neither to the Romans, Corinths, nor in any of his Epiſtles, which ſurely he would have done had it beene of ſuch concernment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This objection is built upon a miſtake of their Epiſtles; for they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> were not written to perſons unbaptized, but already baptized: So that it was needleſſe to urge Baptiſme to them: Yet we ſhall finde <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> telling them they had need to have the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt taught them againe; of which Baptiſme is one. But if you looke into the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> you will there finde Baptiſme to be practiſed as much as any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for there are the travels of the Apoſtles, and their doctrine to unbelievers regiſtred; where you ſhall finde thouſands bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: Now Baptiſme is part of the foundation in the houſe of God, which muſt not be laid againe.</p>

               <p>Thus have I endeavoured, according to my talent, to anſwer all thoſe objections I have yet met withall of any moment; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it will now appeare to thee, that Baptiſme of water is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Lord Jeſus, and not to be ſo carnall as men ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but a ſpirituall Ordinance, whoſe author, principle leading to it, power enabling to performe it, and true end of conformity to it, are all ſpirituall, which though in a ſenſe, <hi>viz:</hi> as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with water, may be called externall or outward: yet the ſpirit and life of it is like the Kings Daughter, <hi>Pſalme 45.

               <p>Some ſay, <hi>Tis a yoake,</hi> and they ſay true; but it is <hi>Christs yoake, whoſe yoake is eaſy, and his burden is light:</hi> others ſay, if they ſhould

               <head type="sub">Sheweth that believers being baptized, ought to be added to the Church, and what the true Goſpell-Church is.</head>
               <p>THE firſt thing being made manifeſt, that all believers are to be baptized,</p>
               <p>I come to the ſecond thing I promiſed to diſcover to you which <note place="margin">The Saints baptized are to be added to the Church</note> was the command of Chriſt; for thoſe that were baptized to be added to to the Church.</p>
               <p>By Church I here underſtand ſome particular viſible Church; which every believer ought to be a member of, and adde himſelfe to it. Tis not enough to be baptized, which viſibly enrights him into any Church; but he muſt be taught to obſerve all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whereof this is one, to joine himſelfe to ſome particular <hi>Church or Congregation;</hi> Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Acts 2. 42. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayers.</hi> Marke it, they were not onely baptized, but walked in the viſible fellowſhip of the Goſpell. And againe it is ſaid, <hi>verſe 47. And the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> And againe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>Thoſe that believed conſorted to Paul and Silas:</hi> they embodied themſelves together, <hi>and cleaved to the Apostles, verſe</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>That it is the duty of Saints thus to do, I ſhall manifeſt by two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. From the nature of the Saints they are all one in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; they are <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſheepe, the nature of whom is to flocke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>they are members one of another.</hi> Now it behooveth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:117308:83"/> to be fixed in their owne body, they are the ſouldiers of the Lord, who ought to be in continuall order.</p>
               <p>But 2. It appeares from the nature of the doctrine of Chriſt, which points at unity; one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head; God is one, they are one; the Goſpell is one; all which proclaimes it to be their duty to walke together as one in the Church, which is Chriſts body.</p>
               <p>But to make things appeare more plainly, I ſhall ſhew you what the true Church of Chriſt is; to which every believer being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ought to be added.</p>
               <p>It is a company of people called out and ſeparated from the <note place="margin">What the true Church of Chriſt is.</note> world by the word of the Goſpell to believe in Chriſt, being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of the Lord Jeſus; walking together in mutuall agreement in the viſible profeſſion of the Goſpell of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their Head and King.</p>
               <p>I am not now treating of the Church of Chriſt as it is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſiſting of all Saints in all ages, making up one body, but of a particular, viſible ſociety or congregation of people; who are that Church I have before deſcribed; in which deſcription there are theſe things obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſts Church conſiſts of people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it conſiſts of people called or ſeparated from the world by the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are a company of believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are believers baptized in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That they are united together by conſent, in the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpell; all which I ſhall handle briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſts Church are onely people; I minde this in <note place="margin">That Chriſts Church are only people.</note> a way of oppoſition to that carnall apprehenſion of ignorant ſoules, who eſteeme Houſes of ſtone or timber to be the Churches of <hi>Christ:</hi> not conſidering, that <hi>That the moſt High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, Acts 17. 24.

               <p>Secondly, The church of Chriſt conſiſts of people called out of <note place="margin">Chriſts Church is a people called out of the world.</note> the World, wherein you may obſerve, that the very ſame men and

               <p>We are to ſeparate from all aſſemblyes who ſay they are Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet <hi>are not built upon the Rock Chriſt, and the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the corner ſtone.</hi> There is much adoe made about churches this day, but there is but one true way of entring into a true Church fellowſhip, therefore are we to ſeparate from all thoſe ſeeming Churches, who never were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church, through the preaching of the Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the doctrine of Chriſt, being baptized into his name, but were naturally borne into it, as all thoſe are who ſtand in a any Church by right of infant memberſhip, or infant Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Chriſts Church conſiſts of a people viſibly profeſſing faith, all in Chriſts Kingdome muſt be able to declare whoſe they are, whom they profeſſe, whoſe ſubjects they be, and to whoſe laws they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, therefore we ſhall finde the <hi>Eunuch</hi> not to be admitted to baptiſme, <hi>Except he believed with all his heart.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, I ſay, there can be no true viſible Church, without it hath its bottome or foundation from Chriſt, but there is no church conſiſting of others then baptized perſons, approved on by Chriſt, for Chriſt giving forth a rule of viſible diſpenſations, bids his diſciples, firſt, <hi>Teach and Baptize them,</hi> afterwards, <hi>teach them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all that he had commanded them.</hi> Marke laſt. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Again, if we conſider the nature of the Ordinance of baptiſme, and of the church of Chriſt it will be evident, for the nature of the Ordinance is a cleer manifeſtation of putting on Chriſt; therfore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Know ye not, that as many of you, as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt;</hi> and the nature of a true Church, is of a ſpirituall nature viſibly holding forth that government Chriſt our head hath in us: Again, baptiſm is the firſt act viſibly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our union with Chriſt, which gives us a viſible right to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances of Chriſt; But if any ſhall yet ſay there may be a true viſible church of the Goſpel approved of by Chriſt without a ſubmiſſion to this Ordinance, let them produce their grounds from the Scripture, and I ſhall more throughly conſider the matter: in the mean time, let this ſuffice us, that while men walke in other wayes doubtfully, without a rule for their practiſe, we walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures in being baptized, and added to the church, &amp; wheras they ſay many churches were planted without baptiſm; it is an eaſy thing to ſay ſo, but hard for to prove, I am very confident all churches were baptized, elſe the diſciples of Chriſt had very ill obſerved their commands, <hi>Goe teach, and baptize.</hi>

               <p>The nature of this church, I ſhall firſt handle, which I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate <note place="margin">The nature of Chriſts Church: It is the houſe of God.</note> to you from the ſeverall names that God hath given it in the Scriptures; as firſt, it is called the <hi>Houſe of Chriſt, or of the living God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. <hi>Paul</hi> gave many inſtructions to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how to behave himſelf, in <hi>the houſe of God; God dwelleth in the middeſt of the church,</hi> the church is <hi>Gods houſhold,</hi> Mat. 24. 25. Herein may we
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:117308:85"/> ſee the nature of the church to be a compact and united body, <hi>a houſe of living ſtones,</hi> 1 Peter 2. 4. 'tis not a company of unpoliſhed ſtones, lying ſcattered up and downe, but a houſe built up, <hi>whoſe foundation is Chriſt,</hi> yea, <hi>Chriſt is the corner ſtone thereof;</hi> 'tis a <hi>houſhold,</hi> whoſe maſter is Chriſt, who is the Lord of that family, which is called by his name; the children of this houſhold are Saints thoſe that appear in their <hi>wedding garment;</hi> the ſervants are the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpell,</hi> who are placed there to ſerve the family; their food is the word of God; the body and blood of Chriſt Jeſus; from whence al unprofitable and wicked ſervants are tobe caſt forth; 'tis a houſhold, wherein every ſon and ſervant is enrolled by the bond of unity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'tis the <hi>City of God,</hi> Pſalm. 46. 4. in which city every <note place="margin">It is the City of God.</note> member is a <hi>fellow citizen,</hi> Eph. 2. 19.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The church of Chriſt, is Chriſts body, Chriſt</hi> is the churches <note place="margin">It is Chriſts body.</note> head; yea, he is the very <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of the church, 'tis his Spirit which quickens all: 'tis <hi>Chriſts body</hi> conſiſting of ſeverall members, every one is placed in the body, for the ſervice of the whole, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Paul, We being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another.</hi> Rom. 12. 5.

'tis a <hi>flock of ſheep</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together having one chief ſhepheard, who ſeparates them from the goates, and keepes them from wolves, who knows them by name; 'tis his ſheepfold wherein all his ſheepe are folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not ſtragling up and down, but in flocks together, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord Jeſus, knowing his voyce. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>'Tis a <hi>candleſtick of pure gold,</hi> to hold forth the true light of the Lord; 'tis a <hi>dove,</hi> innocent and gentle, feeding on the choyſeſt food; 'tis the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> wherein Chriſt and Saints mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually communicate each to other, Chriſt to them, light, life, joy, freedome, and glory; they to Chriſt, praiſe, honor, reverence, and ſongs of deliverance; 'tis a <hi>Communion,</hi> wherein they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate each to other of al thoſe treaſures the Father of Spirits hath communicated to them; 'tis a <hi>ſhip,</hi> in this world toſſed up and down, yet ſafely arrives at the haven of everlaſting glory, through the guidance of their skilfull Pilot the Lord Jeſus</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:117308:86"/>
               <p>It is the <hi>Kingdome of prieſts, a Kingdome of kings,</hi> a kingdome from above, the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi> whoſe head, Iawes and inheritance are all heavenly: Thus mayeſt thou ſee its nature to be ſpirituall pure, peaceable, mighty, gracious, and glorious, being one with the Father, and the Son, and with each other viſibly in the Father and the Son: I might dwell longer here, but I muſt paſſe forward.</p>
               <p>The next thing I ſhall handle, is the power of this Church, <note place="margin">The power of the Church.</note> which is very large, conſider what power a <hi>Kingdome, family, city, or body</hi> hath for the well-ordering, governing, and increaſing of its ſelfe, this church hath the ſame: I ſhall branch its power forth in ſeverall particulars.</p>
               <p>1. In receiving of members, 'tis a houſhold that can admit none to <note place="margin">In receiving in members.</note> be of the family, but ſuch who are enrolled as houſhold ſervants, that this power is in them, is evident, for <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Jeruſalem, and aſſayed to joyne himſelfe to the diſciples, but they were all afraid of him;</hi> Yet they were perſons with whom he indeavoured to joyne himſelfe, which he had ignorantly done, had not they a power to receive him; <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26. 27. Againe, <hi>Phebe a ſervant of the Church of Cenchrea,</hi> being to goe to the church of <hi>Rome, Paul</hi> commends her to them, <hi>deſiring them to receive her in the Lord, as becommeth Saints;</hi> where note, <hi>Paul</hi> commends her to the whole church, to all the Saints there who were to receive her, but that the church hath this power is evident, for as I ſhall ſhew you preſently they have power to caſt out alſo; now this receiving in of members ought to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged faithfully; any perſon baptized deſiring, according to his duty, to walk with any particular congregation, except any ſhould know by a viſible demonſtration that he was unworthy ought to be received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how ought the church to receive them that are members of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>If a member of one congregation ſhould have occaſion to goe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw </seg>
                  </label> to another, they ought to be recommended from the Church or ſome particular brethren to them, which is plaine in the caſe of <hi>Phebe's</hi> going to <hi>Rome, Paul</hi> wrote a commendation to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring <hi>them to receive her;</hi> Rom. 16. ſo in the caſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, as when he ſent <hi>Tichicus</hi> to the church of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> he writes to them, <hi>that he was a beloved brother, a faithfull minister and fellow ſervant in the Lord.</hi> Coloſ. 4. 7. 8. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>But what, if by a providence unknown to the Church, or unexſpected by him, a member ſhould be caſt into another congregation, having no ſuch letter of recommendation, may not the church receive him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:117308:87"/>
               <p>To this I ſay, firſt, if any member knowes him, or her to be a brother or a ſiſter his declaration or teſtimony is ſufficient to the Church, as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Pauls joyning</hi> with the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> while he abode there, it was upon <hi>Barna bas</hi> his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but if none knowes him, the Church upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his faith and obedience to the commands of Chriſt, and of his orderly walking, may, except they know any thing to the contrary, receive him; for the reaſon why the church at Jeruſalem received not <hi>Paul</hi> was, becauſe they had heard what miſchief he had done; but here the church needs much wiſdome, and if they can (I judge) they would doe well to inquire of him, if he be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main among them, leſt he be one that ſhould come in privily to <note place="margin">In admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving members.</note> ſow tares amongſt the wheate.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The church hath power in admoniſhing and reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their members; now admonition is twofold, either in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of them, or a warning of the church, or any member thereof, from all evill; ſhewing them the dangerous conſequence of it; therefore the Apoſtles, in the firſt ſenſe ſpeaking to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> bids them <hi>admoniſh one another with Pſalmes, &amp;c.</hi> In the laſt ſenſe he writes to the whole church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Now we exhort you brethren, warn or admoniſh them that are unruly:</hi> Now in the churches warning them that are unruly, they ought to conſider the nature of the offence, for offences or ſins are either <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publike;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate offence is</note> a private offence is that which is committed againſt a particular perſon, now this, every Saints offended ought to reprove privately, this is an offence that is not a publike ſcandall to the Goſpel, but <note place="margin">What it is to ſin openly.</note> publike ſins are ſuch as are open and manifeſt, which in their own nature are of a publike ſcandall or offence, theſe are to be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, admoniſhed or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reproved publikely, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Peters</hi> diſſembling, <hi>Paul withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed;</hi> yea, he blamed, <hi>or reproved him before them all.</hi> Gal. 2. 11. 14. ſo that offences that are publikely known to the church, the church ſhould openly reprove them; herein <hi>Pauls</hi> rule holds good, <hi>them that ſin, rebuke before all, that others may feare.</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20. or thoſe ſins which have been of a private concernment, and the perſons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending having been dealt withall according to Chriſts command ſaying, <hi>If thy brother offend thee, goe tell him of it between thee and him, &amp;c.</hi> and if they who have committed the offence ſhall refuſe to heare them, they may bring it bring it before the church, as Chriſt ſaith,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:117308:87"/> if he ſhall refuſe to heare thee, tell it to the Church, then the Church may, and ought to take notice of it, and admoniſh him for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is there no difference betweene admonition, reproofe and rebuking in</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Qu. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>the Scriptures? becauſe you ſeeme to put no difference betweene them, and the Scripture doth; for Paul bids Timothy, reprove and rebuke, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſome one of theſe words, being uſed alone, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the reſt; as in the caſe of Heretikes being caſt forth after <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> twice admonition. The word, <hi>Admonition,</hi> includes rebuking or reproving: but when we finde them diſtinguiſhed, tis after this manner, to Admoniſh, is to adviſe another, or forewarne him of ſome danger; to Reprove him, is to blame him for ſome evill, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the nature of his evill, and the greatneſſe of his fault, as <hi>Paul</hi> did blame <hi>Peter.</hi> But to Rebuke, ſignifies a more powerfull way of reproofe: therefore he ſaith, Rebuke them ſharply: ſo to rebuke them, is to command them, to deſiſt their evil courſes, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, with great authority; <hi>Therefore an Elder is not to be rebuked but entreated, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>This rebuking is for them who are unruly; therfore when Chriſt caſt out Devils, he is ſaid to rebuke them: ſo if any ſhall make commotions in the Church, and be unruly, the Church muſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them, ſtoppe their mouths, command them to be ſilent; for this the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to doe.</p>
               <p>Now in reproving I ſhall give theſe few briefe directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it be done without partiality, to the higheſt as well as to the meaneſt, the richeſt as the pooreſt; for we muſt not have the faith in reſpect of perſons: Husbands muſt not pleade for their Wives; fleſhly relations muſt not mingle themſelves with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all affaires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be done in love; therefore is the <hi>Church</hi> commanded, having noted a diſorderly brother, to admoniſh him as a brother: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all your things be done in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it be done ſeaſonably, with good advice and caution: minding alwaies the frame of his heart whom you reprove.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be done with all authority; let none deſpiſe it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Church may chooſe whom ſhee pleaſe, to declare her ſenſe and minde: this, if the Church hath officers choſen, is <note place="margin">The Church may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about civill things.</note> moſt fit to be performed by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The power of the Church appeares, in determining all controverſies in the Church in civill things, if there ſhould ariſe

How dare you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) goe to Law before unbelievers?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what if the Church ſhould order any of them to give ſatisfaction to the</hi>

               <p>Secondly, They have a power to determine matters of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">About indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things.</note> about indifferent things: as, ſuppoſe there ſhould ariſe diſputes about habits, or meats, or drinkes; the Church hath power to end them. God in his wiſedome hath ſo ordered the matter, that he hath given us many commands plainly and particularly: but yet we have many occaſions of diſpute about things ſimply, neither commanded nor forbidden. Now the Church may determine theſe according to <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <hi>If there be any thing of good report, virtuous, praiſe-worthy, thinke of theſe things.</hi> The Church hath power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their times of meeting, their continuance when met, of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their owne officers or ſervants; as in the caſe of the ſeven Deacons is evident, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They have power to caſt out members, to deliver <note place="margin">The Church hath power of caſting out members.</note> them to Satan; as it appeares, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. verſe 7. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that yee may be a new lumpe.</hi> Now this was written by <hi>Paul</hi> to the whole Church: Now his caſting forth, or delivering up to Satan, is the returning of his perſon into the Kingdome from <note place="margin">What it is to be delivered to Satan.</note> whence be came; <hi>Wee, while dead in ſinne, are in the Kingdome of Satan;</hi> but being made to believe in Chriſt, are <hi>tranſlated</hi> into his Church, <hi>the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> Now when any declare their hearts not to be right, but viſibly to belong to the Kingdom of Satan, they are to be put forth from the Church into their owne Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> this world, whoſe God Satan is.</p>
               <p>This Ordinance is an Ordinance of Chriſt, to be done in Chriſts name, power and authority, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, for the rooting out of corruptions: it muſt be pronounced with love, and yet with faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:117308:88"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for what cauſe ought any member to be caſt out of the Church?</hi>

               <p>Secondly, For open, ſcandalous wickedneſſe, as adultery, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, theft, lying, drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, or the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For refuſing to heare the Church; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If any man refuſe to heare the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> And againe, <hi>If any man among you walke diſorderly, have no company with him that he may be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>his repentance to the Church, before he be caſt out ought the Church to caſt him forth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No verily, For if the Church can judge their repentance to bee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> true, they may not doe it; for the end of the Ordinance is, if the Lord ſee it good for their repentance. Now if the Lord makes them repent without it, to what purpoſe wilt thou doe it? This appeares to me cleare from <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. Who ſaith, <hi>He is afraid he ſhall be humbled among the Corinths, and bewaile them which have ſinned already and have not repented of their uncleanneſſe and fornication which they have committed.</hi> Which words, I ſay, intimate to me, they ought to have repented of their evill deeds: and if they had done ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> need not have bewailed them; but their not repenting made him to be afraid.</p>
               <p>5. They have power to receive in members (who were caſt out) <note place="margin">The Church may receive members who were caſt out if they repent</note> upon their repentance: Conſider, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9. Wee may there ſee <hi>Paul</hi> writing to them, <hi>to forgive a wicked perſon, lest he ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow, and confirme their loves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this repentance be true, it cauſeth the ſoule to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his ſinne, to acknowledge it before the Church, to mourne for it, and to deſire again to be received by them for if in truth he ſeeth his evill, he will deſire to be entertained againe by that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that caſt him forth, that they may have cauſe of joy in him, as well as once, they had of ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is not the whole Church that hath this power, but the repreſentative Church;</hi> viz: <hi>the Officers in the Church; ſo that when Chriſt ſaith, tell it to the Church, he meanes the Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I briefly anſwer; That the Church, <hi>viz:</hi> the whole
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117308:89"/> Church hath this power; as is evident in the caſting forth of the inceſtuous perſon: <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Church, bids them, <hi>Purge out the old leaven:</hi> he doth not write to the officers of the Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to the whole Church: So <hi>Acts</hi> 15. when the whole Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to adviſe concerning a difference, <hi>The whole Church came together, and gave their adviſe:</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>The Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren ſend greeting, verſe</hi> 23. Some bring this place to prove a Nationall Synod but if it ſhould prove ſuch a thing, behold the whole Nation muſt be this Synod; for the whole multitude were there; <hi>viz:</hi> of the Church with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Elders, where every brother had his liberty to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Apoſtle Paul caſt out Hymeneus and Alexander, and delivered them</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>to Satan; ſo that excommunication is to be performed by an officer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold a thing here conſiderable; that which <hi>Paul</hi> did in his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> owne perſon by himſelfe, is likewiſe done by a Church with his conſent: therefore ſaith he, <hi>I have judged already as though I were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, concerning him that hath done this deed: In the name of the Lord Jeſus, when you are gathered together, and my ſpirit, That you deliver ſuch a one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. Pauls</hi> ſpirit is his will, approbation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; ſo that what the Apoſtle might doe in perſon, they might do by the ſame power and ſpirit that was in him and them: ſo that this is no argument at all to prove any ſuch thing: <hi>Now the end of this power given to the Church, is not for deſtruction, but edification.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus finiſhed the nature and power of the Church, I <note place="margin">The duty of the Church.</note> come to ſhew them their duty, and that under a three-fold conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of members to members; their duty is to watch over each <note place="margin">Of members to members.</note> other: Under the Law, God placed watchmen over his people, at whoſe hands the bloud of them that miſcarried through the watchmens negligence, was required, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 16. Chriſt hath ſet the Saints in one body, to be carefull of each other; to watch over their words and actions at home and abroad, wherever they have opportunity; They ought alſo to cover the infirmities one of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:117308:89"/> another: there is a great fault among Chriſtians this day, who delight to ſpread abroad the infirmities of their brethren: If thy brother offend thee, tis thy duty, oh man, <hi>to tell him of it firſt, betweene thee and him;</hi> if he heares thee, thou haſt gained him, thou oughteſt to forgive him: <hi>If he refuſes to heare thee, take two or three more with thee; and if he refuſe to heare them,</hi> (and not before, as thou expecteſt to be freed from the charge of a violater of the command of the Lord Jeſus:) <hi>Tell it to the Church, and if he refuſe to heare them, let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> Yet further, tis the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every member to aſſiſt, exhort, adviſe, counſell and helpe his fellow member; to relieve his neceſſities: tis our duty to ſtudy to pleaſe one another in the Lord. This watch ſhould be over one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in all things, in all places, at all times, in all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The duty of the Saints in the Church, is to frequent <note place="margin">Of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers duty to the Church;</note> their aſſemblyes, not to leave them, not to burthen, or trouble, or offend them; to contribute their utmoſt aſſiſtance to them; to help forward the building; to warne the Church of any thing may endanger it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The duty of the whole is to looke to each member, to <note place="margin">The duty of the Church toward its members.</note> enquire how it is with them in ſoule and body, to adminiſter to their wants, to reprove, rebuke, admoniſh, receive in, caſt out; this watch of theirs ought to have an eye into all relations; many may live well in the Church, but we muſt enquire after every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their behaviour towards wives or husbands, parents or children, maſters or ſervants; for many may, at home be paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, careleſſe, give ill examples, be idle, or the like; which cannot be diſcerned in the Church; but this ought we to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By vertue oſ what authority have you to do to meddle with one another in civill</hi>

                  </label> live ſutable to the Goſpell in civill things: how ſhall wee ſee the power of the doctrine preached, except in their converſation, and how ſhall we know that, except we be converſant with them, or enquire of them. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>A Biſhop muſt be no striker, &amp;c.</hi> which qualities muſt be knowne to the Church, or elſe how can they chooſe him? <hi>Paul</hi> tooke notice of mans idleneſſe, and of others diſobedience, which makes him urgent in theſe relations to preſſe conformity to the Law of the Lord Jeſus: I ſay, the Church ought
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117308:90"/> to ſtrengthen, build up, and edifie each other in love.</p>
               <p>I am now come to ſpeak of the ſpirituall gifts given to this <hi>Church;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the duty of the Church. A word of Wiſedome.</note> which are divers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A word of Wiſedome; now a word of Wiſedome is a gift, whereby a ſoule is made able, not onely to behold the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Lord, but is alſo able to bring them forth ſeaſonably, orderly, advantageouſly for the whole: tis a word that is able wel to rule, order, mannage and diſpoſe of the things of the Church, for the edification of the whole.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A word of Knowledge; Knowledge is that gift where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">A word of Knowledge.</note> we underſtand the truth of God: there are many ſayings darke in the Scripture, now the word of knowledge makes them cleare and evident; reſolveth doubts, and teacheth the ignorant: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedome differ (as I judge) onely in this, that the true ordering, and wiſe diſpoſing of knowledge it ſelfe, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the whole, is attributed to wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Diſcerning of ſpirits; Here muſt be knowledge in <note place="margin">Diſcerning of ſpirits.</note> this alſo; for this is that by which we are enabled to try ſpirits by their doctrine, for this is the very way that the Lord preſcribes for the tryall of ſpirits; <hi>viz:</hi> by their doctrine, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. This diſcerning of ſpirits is not, as many conceive, that we ſhould immediately know whether their ſpirits be right or no, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies then by their doctrine and converſation; which gift is not given to all, but to thoſe, <hi>who by reaſon of ſpirituall uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcerne betweene good and evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Propheſy; Which Propheſy is two-fold: either a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of things to come; as <hi>Philips</hi> daughters, &amp; <hi>Agabus</hi> did; or elſe it <note place="margin">Propheſy.</note> is a ſpeaking in the Church, to edification, exhortation &amp; conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 3. Thus may all propheſy one by one, and the reſt judg.</hi> This propheſy is an excellent gift, whereby the Church is edefied, the Lord glorified, and Satan put to flight. I ſhall in this ſhew you the true ground and power of propheſy, the perſons who are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, and the true uſe and of propheſy.</p>
               <p>The true ground of propeſy is the true knowledge of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">The true ground of propheſy.</note> of Jeſus, which is the doctrine of Chriſt; except a ſoule be led through the inſpiration of God in the light of God, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly propheſy; the power enabling to it, is the power in the new creation, <hi>We believe, and therefore we ſpeake.</hi> Many conceive Saints are not to propheſy, till they have ſuch an immediate power
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117308:90"/> ſeizing upon them, which may force them to ſpeake whether they will or no; which, for my part, for theſe two reaſons, I judge contrary to Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe we are commanded, <hi>Not to quench the ſpirit, nor deſpiſe propheſying:</hi> Now if propheſy did ſo move in a man who could quench the ſpirit of it, ſurely it would worke irreſiſtibly.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon why I ſo judge, is, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets:</hi> Now herein are they ſubject, that <hi>One muſt ſtay till the other holds his peace, and the reſt muſt judge</hi> what is delivered, Now, I ſay, theſe two things would be fruſtrate, was it by ſuch a power ſome pleade for: for what need any to be judge, if it comes with ſuch a power? And how could they ſtay one for another, or keepe ſilence one for another, if ſuch a power was in them: But this, I ſay, there is or ought to be ſuch a power as may enable them, <hi>To ſpeak to edification, exhortation &amp; comfort &amp; that by courſe:</hi> that there be no confuſion: and this is propheſy upon a good ground. I ſhall onely to this particular adde this word, that wee are no where commanded to judge the principle of a brothers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings, neither his acting by his principle, but his principle by his actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The perſons who may ſo propheſy, are all the brethren, <note place="margin">who may propheſy.</note> all the Prophets: Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Yee may all propheſy:</hi> this all he interprets to be the Prophets ſaying, <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeake two or three, and let the reſt judge, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May not women propheſy in the Church? Surely, it is ſaid, a woman pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> or propheſying; which implyes ſhee may propheſy as well as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this, conſider the ſame Apoſtle that ſaith, <hi>Let the</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Prophets propheſy;</hi> in the ſame Chapter alſo ſaith, <hi>Let your women keep</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Whether a woman may ſpeak in the Church. 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſilence in the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeake:</hi> from whence, and from that in <hi>Timothy, Let the woman learne in ſilence, with all ſubjection; But I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurpe authority.</hi> I conclude, a woman may not ſo propheſy as the brethren may, in the 14 of <hi>Cor.</hi> and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion through her forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to teach, and aſpiring above her place, ſhe was firſt deceived, and did deceive her husband.</p>
               <p n="2">2. She is more ſubject to temptation, and to be deluded by reaſon of the weakneſſe of her nature: Now God will have her learne in ſilence; ſhe that taught the man to his fall, muſt now be taught by him, and be in ſubjection.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:117308:91"/>3. That hereby ſhe may manifeſt her humility, in willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſubject, who ſubjected her husband through her enticement to ſo much miſery.</p>
               <p>But yet, notwithſtanding, when I conſider the reaſon of their being commanded ſilence, to be taken from the Law, and yet under the Law; <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Deborah</hi> were <hi>Propheteſſes:</hi> And when I minde that God made a promiſe, <hi>That his ſonnes and daughters ſhould propheſy:</hi> And <hi>that Philip had foure daughters which did propheſy, Acts</hi> 21. 9. And when I weigh <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying, <hi>A woman praying or propheſying with her head covered;</hi> it makes me believe, that a woman may propheſy, and that in the Church alſo: So that, I ſay, wee muſt neceſſarily conſider the manner of her ſpeaking to be here forbidden: ſhe may propheſy, as propheſy is conſidered an immediate gift from heaven, for the revelation of ſome great, ſecret, or myſtery, that the brethren are ignorant of; or for the foretelling of things to come, ſhe may ſpeake, being carried out thereunto by a power from the Lord; yet in this, her head, her owne honour and glory muſt be covered: without controverſy, when <hi>paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He permits not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſpeake in the Church,</hi> he forbids not all manner of ſpeaking: for then if the Church ſhould demand any queſtion of her, ſhe might not anſwer; which certainly ſhe may: So that, I ſay, this ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe is debarred of, is teaching, as the brethren who are prophets, may all doe, one by one; ſhe muſt not ſo teach in the Church to diſhonour her head.</p>
               <p>But if God hath given greater gifts to them then to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; <note place="margin">How women ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their gifts.</note> I ſhall ſhew them how they ought to improve them; <hi>viz.</hi> by taking a brother home to their houſes, as <hi>Priſcilla</hi> did <hi>Apollos;</hi> and there inſtructing him in the way of the Lord more perfectly, or by teaching one another modeſty, ſobriety, meekneſſe, humility, love and holineſſe; this I am ſure is their duty: therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, The aged women muſt be teachers of good things, teaching the young women to be ſober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be diſcreet, chaſt, keepers at home, good, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blaſphemed, Tit.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The end of propheſy, it ſerves for the Church, for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up in faith, knowledge, feare and love; for exhortation from ſinne to righteouſneſſe, for comfort in feares, doubts, terrours, temptations; the end of that, as of all other Ordinances, is to glorifie God, and ſerve our ſpirituall generation, <hi>Our City is built on Mount Sion, compact within it ſelfe.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of the Ordinances, Order, Miniſtry, and Communion of the Church.</head>
               <p>THe Ordinances of this Church, I ſhall now ſpeak of (having <note place="margin">The Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church. viz. Prayer.</note> ſpoken already of propheſie, which is a gift and an Ordinance to be practiſed,) are theſe following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Prayer, <hi>all things are to be ſanctified by the Word of God, and prayer,</hi> this was practiſed in the Church with an audible voice, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 24. &amp; ſo <hi>Paul kneeled down, &amp; prayed with the diſciples.</hi> Act. 20. 26. Now prayer is the pouring out of the ſoul to God, by way of ſupplication for the ſupply of ourwants by Jeſus Chriſt, which prayer is or ought to be the continnall poſture of Saints ſpirits, according to that of <hi>Paul, pray continually;</hi> therefore we ſhall find the church <hi>continuing in prayer.</hi> Acts. 2. 42. this is a ſpeciall part of divine worſhip, whereby we acknowledge Gods preheminency; our relation, ſubjection, and obedience unto God: I might here ſhew you the prevalency of the prayers of Saints, with God, had I time; but I ſhal conclude this with theſe three things, which I deſire may alwayes accompany prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith, <hi>beleeving that God is,</hi> that he heares us, and is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mercifull, and will anſwer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Watchfulneſſe, <hi>watch unto prayer,</hi> watch and pray, watch over thy heart, thy corruptions to ſuppreſſe and ſubdue them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſtancy, continue in praying, for he will in due time anſwer, caſt not away thy prayers, but expect their returne loaden with bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Praiſe, Praiſe is that the Lord takes delight in, and <note place="margin">Praiſe.</note> yet hath in himſelf no addition of honour by it, the true praiſe of God, is the acknowledgement of the glory and excellency of the Lord; 'tis the declaration of the goodneſſe of the Almighty; this praiſe is to be in the mighty congregation. <hi>I will give thee thanks</hi> ſaith David, <hi>in the great congregation, I will praiſe thee among much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Pſalm. 35. 18. 145. 1. Chriſt and the Saints both ſing praiſes in the church together unto God the Father, this true praiſing of God from the power of the Spirit, did the Pſalmes, ſung upon mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall inſtruments under the law, point at; the gift of ſinging
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:117308:92"/> Pſalms is not a compoſition of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms into Meter, through <note place="margin">Of finging Pſalmes.</note> a naturall faculty, which Pſalms the Prieſt or the Clarke names; and all the people muſt fing together, this begets a confuſion, and is a meer tradition, for ſuch a practiſe hath no more bottom then Organs or Choriſters or Singing men and women, in the Church of the Goſpel; which ſurely we will not plead for now: The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of Pſalmes is not in the ear, but in the heart to the Lord. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 19. To ſing Pſalmes in the Goſpel is, a ſpeciall gift given to ſome particular member in the church, whereby he doth bleſſe, praiſe, or magnifie the Lord, through the mighty operation of the Spirit. <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 18, 19. which is to beperformed, I ſay, by one alone, at one time to the edification one of another, and therefore it is an Ordinance flowing from a cheerfull heart; if any be merry let him ſing Pſalmes, that is to ſay, let him bleſſe God; that all ſhould ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is denied by <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>how is it brethren when yee come together every one of you hath a Pſalme,</hi> they muſt ſpeak orderly one after another, <hi>for God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace in all the Churches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faſting; now true faſting flowes from the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Faſting.</note> of ſome great want, whereby the ſoul is ingaged to give up himſelf to ſeek the Lord, ſeparating himſelfe from his outward imployments from meat and drink, ſo farre as nature will permit, that he may wholly without diſtraction, be earneſt with the Lord by prayer, for the obtaining of his requeſt, the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this will appear evident, if you conſider, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3. 14. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Charity, which is more acceptable then hope or faith, <note place="margin">Charity.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. this is that virtue without which al other gifts are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; it is a grace which is rooted in the heart, and is a true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall love and endeared affection towards his Lord Jeſus, and all his Saints, poor and rich; which compoſeth the Spirit in a right temper, ſubduing covetouſneſſe, trampling under foot vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, loving another as himſelf; the prayſe of which read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. verſes. <hi>It ſuffereth long, is kinde, envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinks no evill, rejoyceth not in iniquity but in the truth, beareth all things, &amp;c.</hi> but I ſhall only mind it here, as it <note place="margin">That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Saints muſt be relieved.</note> ſhewes it ſelfe forth in the relief of the Saints outward neceſſities; It is an Ordinance of God to relieve the poor Saints.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of the Church to ſee that no member in it do want
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:117308:93"/> or lack any thing neceſſary; 'tis not enought to ſay be warmed but they muſt adminiſter to the ſupply of their wants according to the ability God hath given them. <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 16. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all Saints are to have all things common, ſo that there muſt be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>between them, as it was in the dayes of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſtake not the Scriptures, it is no where commanded, it is true <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> there was a time when all things were common, yet ſo, that every man had but accoridng to his need, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 45. 4. 34. 35. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſold their poſſeſſions, they then teſtified their great charity and thus far it is a preſident for Saints to imitate, that if they have poſſeſſions, and their brethren be in want, and they cannot to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved without ſelling their poſſeſſions, they ought to ſell them; yet not ſo, as to deſtroy their naturall relations, <hi>for he that provideth not for his family, is worſe then an infidell:</hi> But this was not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe for afterward they had gatherings as God proſpered them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. and indeed had that been always commanded to be therepractiſe, wherin could there have been a ground to preſſe to charity, and to reprove for covetouſneſſe; there alwayes hath been and yet wil be a difference among men in this world, there was an <hi>elect Lady,</hi> one of reputation (though few noble are called) who lived accordingly, abounding in hoſpitality, yet we are alwayes to mind this, that we ought <hi>not to have the faith, in reſpect of perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Breaking of bread: now I wil ſhew you very briefly four <note place="margin">Breaking of bread or the Lords ſupper Chriſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</note> things conſiderable in this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who was the author of it, that is the Lord Jeſus, that ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What doth that ſpeech concerne us, being ſpoken only to his diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not a command only to them, but to others alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> that which I have received of the Lord Jeſus I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to you, <hi>doe you eat thereof. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The perſons for whom he ordained it; and they are <note place="margin">Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. The nature of this Ordinance</note> viſible beleevers in Church fellowſhip, ſuch as could <hi>examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> ſuch as could diſcern the <hi>Lords body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The true nature of this Ordinance, which is ſpirituall holding forth Chriſts death unto one another; for it is not an Ordinance for the world, but the Church; and likewiſe it holds forth <hi>our</hi> union with Chriſt; <hi>for the bread we break, is the Body of Chriſt, and the Cup is his blood, the blood of the Covenant,</hi> and it manifeſts our union one with another; <hi>for we being many are one bread,</hi> it is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:117308:93"/> a viſible ſeal to us of our intereſt in the Lord Jeſus, which is to be performed in knowledge, faith, <hi>diſcerning Chriſts Body,</hi> that is to ſay, ſeeing Chriſt, to be the true bread, and only food of a Saint he that performs it not ſo, doth it not truly: ſome ſay, we are not to doe it, till we ſee our ſelves above it, and live in the cleere apprehenſions of light and life, being onely to hold forth Chriſts death to others, and not an ordinance wherein we feed on Chriſt, but to me its cleer we are to doe it, when we ſee our ſelves moſt barren and empty, for then are Ordinances fitteſt for us, ſo that we by faith ſee Chriſt to have all fulneſſe in him, and by faith meet him in that Ordinance in a way of ſubjection, for it is an Ordinance appointed for our ſouls refreſhing, as well as the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his death one to another.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The duration or continuance of this Ordinance which <note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Ordinance.</note> is till Chriſt comes, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me;</hi> and as often as you doe this ſaith <hi>Paul, you ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſay ſome, we are only to uſe that till Chriſt come in the Spirit, ſo that</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>he being already come in the Spirit, we are not any longer to uſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles meaning is not till Chriſt come in the Spirit, but <hi>till Chriſts ſecond comming without ſin to ſalvation when he ſhall reward both</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>good and bad;</hi> for if you obſerve it, Chriſt was come to <hi>Panl,</hi> and to the <hi>Corinths</hi> in the Spirit, yet they uſed it, and he that truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes to that Ordinance, muſt have the Spirit, for he muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne the Lords body, that is to ſay, the fulneſſe, love, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and virtue of Chriſt, which he cannot do without the Spirit, ſo that for any to ſay, Chriſts comming in the Spirit puts an end to it, he ſaith more then Chriſt, or the Apoſtles ever ſaid: And if what ſuch men ſay, ſhould be true, then this would unavoydably follow, that that diſpenſation, which only gives a true being to an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and without which an Ordinance cannot be rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, muſt be that which puts an end to it, which is contrary to religion, and right reaſon; For I ſay again the diſpenſation of Chriſt in the Spirit, is that which only gives a true right to it, and inables ſpiritually to conform to it, and receive virtue from Chriſt in it.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe objections againſt this, which plead it to be a kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing Chriſt after the fleſh, and the like, I have anſwered them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the doctrine of Baptiſme of water.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſpeak a word or two, to the Order of the Church, <note place="margin">Of the Order of the Church</note> which is that ſweet decent and due adminiſtration of every thing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:117308:94"/> in its right ſeaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. this is that which directs how to ſpeak, when to ſpeak, and what to ſpeak, it forbids all confuſion, many may not ſpeak at once, this puts the adminiſtration of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance in its right place; it firſt commands faith, after that Baptiſme, then Church fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, it doth not turn things upſide down, and ſet the cart before the horſe, as we uſe to ſay, as many men doe in matters of religion, who will firſt break bread, which is an Ordinance for their building up before they be baptized, which viſibly demonſtrates their new birth. This heavenly Order doth not firſt baptize, and then preach converſion; but baptizing thoſe that are already converted, this is that which the Apoſtle rejoyced to behold in the churches. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now ſpeak of the Miniſtry of this Church, which is a <note place="margin">Of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church.</note> ſervice committed by the Lord into the hands of ſome particular Members of the Church, for the due and orderly edification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to whom he hath given the gifts before mentioned, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcharge of their ſaid truſt; which miniſtry, firſt is evident in the brethren generally, afterwards as occaſion requires is committed, eſpecially by way of office, to ſome particulars; wherein I ſhould ſhew you the true nature, ground, uſe, and end of a miniſtry in the Church; but I muſt now haſten a period to this diſcourſe, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereafter if the Lord affords opportunity to enlarge my ſelfe on it, in the mean time know, there may be a true Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out officers, which I ſhall evidence by this demonſtration.</p>
               <p>If you ſearch the Scriptures you ſhall find all officers of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church are to be choſen out of the Church, as is evident in the choice of the ſeven Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and ſo for Elders, they were <hi>to be ordained in the churches.</hi> Tit. 1. 5. which cleerly holds forth the Churches were to be before the officers, for if the church was not firſt, how could it be ſaid, officers muſt be choſen out of them, or ordained in them.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I ſhall now handle, is the communion of the <note place="margin">The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church iswith the Father.</note> church, and that is threefold. Firſt, with the Father and the Son, as ſaith <hi>John, truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and the Son, 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 3. viz. in prayer, prayſe, breaking of bread, and prophecy, <hi>The cup of bleſſing that we bleſſe</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is it not the communion of the blood of Christ; and the bread that we break, is not the communion of the body Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their communion is one with another, which is in the <note place="margin">With each other.</note> light and truth of the Father and the Son, communicating light,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:117308:94"/> knowledge, wiſdome, relief, ſupport, ſuccour and aſſiſtance, each to other, joying, rejoycing and ſorrowing each with other; for <hi>they being many members, are one bread, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the communion the church hath with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">With other Churches.</note> churches; all the churches of Chriſt have but one head, and as members of that head, receive influence from it, and ought to ſeek the good and preſervation each of other; their viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion appears in their union in the doctrine of Chriſt; there are two things principally belonging to churches to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to each other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Advice in matters doubtfull, as is evident <hi>Acts 14. &amp; 15. c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In advice.</note> the church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein we ſee a liberty for every brother, till they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to give their judgement; now this we muſt not underſtand to be a dependency one upon another, but only a ſweet unity and agreement they have each with other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In contributing each to others neceſſities, as if one be over-burthened, it is the duty of another church to contribute, as <note place="margin">In ſupplying each others wants.</note> is evident, <hi>Rom. 15. 26, 27. 2 Cor. 8. and 9. chap. Acts</hi> 11. 29, 30. The glory of the church of Chriſt in all theſe gifts, priviledges and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall immunities to which it is born by the word of God are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, many of them I might here unfold to you, but of all which with our Apoſtle, I muſt <hi>conclude,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I cannot now ſpeak par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider ſeriouſly what I have written, and the Lord give us underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng in all things.</hi>
